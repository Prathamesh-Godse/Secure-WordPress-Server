# Disable Post Revisions in WordPress (`wp-config.php`)

## purpose

To manage and optimize WordPress database performance by controlling or disabling the automatic saving of post revisions through configuration in `wp-config.php`.

## structured document

### What are Post Revisions

WordPress automatically creates a revision every time a post or page is updated. These revisions serve as backups that allow users to restore or compare previous versions of content during editing sessions.

However, on high-content or long-standing websites, excessive revisions can:

* Increase **database size**, consuming more storage.
* Introduce **minor performance degradation**, especially on large-scale deployments.

### Disabling Post Revisions

To disable post revisions entirely, add the following line to your `wp-config.php` file:

```php
define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 'false');
```

This configuration:

* Instructs WordPress to **stop storing any revisions** for posts and pages.
* Ensures that only the most recent version of a post is stored in the database.

### Alternative Configuration: Limit Revisions

If you prefer to keep a limited number of revisions instead of disabling them entirely, use:

```php
define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 5);
```

This setting retains only the **latest 5 revisions per post**, offering a balance between edit history and performance.

### Considerations

* **Disabling revisions** removes the ability to recover earlier versions of content during post editing.
* Suitable for websites that:

  * Rarely update content.
  * Use WordPress primarily as a static website or business site.
  * Require minimal database usage due to resource constraints.

## best practices

* Use revision limiting (`WP_POST_REVISIONS = N`) instead of disabling, unless content versioning is not needed.
* Regularly optimize the database using tools like `WP-Optimize` or `WP-CLI` for cleanup.
* Evaluate whether post revision history is necessary based on the editorial workflow of the site.
* Keep the configuration under version control and ensure consistency across environments (dev, staging, production).
* Backup your `wp-config.php` before making changes, and test changes in a staging environment first.
