### ‚úÖ Disable Post Revisions in WordPress (`wp-config.php`)

When you add this line to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
/** DISABLE POST REVISIONS **/
define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 'false');
```

You're **instructing WordPress not to store any post revisions** in the database. Here's what it means:

---

### üîç What are Post Revisions?

WordPress automatically saves a copy of a post or page every time you update it ‚Äî these are called **revisions**. While helpful during editing, they can:

* Bloat your **database size** over time.
* Slightly affect performance in large sites with many posts and updates.

---

### üö´ What `define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 'false');` Does

* Prevents WordPress from saving **any** post revisions.
* Only the latest saved version of a post/page will exist.

---

### ‚úÖ Alternative Configurations

Instead of disabling completely, you can **limit** the number of revisions like so:

```php
define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 5); // Keep only the last 5 revisions per post
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

* **Disabling completely** means no undo history during content editing.
* Ideal for sites with:

  * Minimal blog content
  * Static or business content
  * Resource optimization priorities
