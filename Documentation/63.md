### ‚úÖ Integrating Security Rules & Verifying Blocked Access

#### ‚úÖ Step Summary:

You're continuing to harden your WordPress Nginx setup. The actions here:

1. **Edit the site config:**
    
    ```bash
    cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
    sudo nano example.com.conf
    ```
    
2. **Paste the path to security rules:**
    
    - Insert this line just **above** the block:
        
        ```nginx
        location ~ \.php$ {
        ```
        
    - Example:
        
        ```nginx
        include /etc/nginx/includes/nginx_security_directives.conf;
        ```
        
3. **Restart Nginx and PHP-FPM:**
    
    ```bash
    ngt   # shortcut to test nginx config
    ngr   # shortcut to reload nginx
    ```

### üîç Verification

After doing this:

- **Visit:**
    
    ```
    https://example.com/readme.html
    ```
    
- **Expected Result:**  
    **403 Forbidden** or **404 Not Found**, depending on whether the file exists or not.
    

If the file exists but is blocked due to your rule:

```nginx
location ~* /readme\.html$ { deny all; }
```

You'll get a **403 Forbidden**.

If it doesn‚Äôt exist at all, you'll see **404 Not Found**.
