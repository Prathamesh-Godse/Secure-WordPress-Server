# Integrating Security Rules & Verifying Blocked Access

## Purpose

To enhance the security of your Nginx-powered WordPress installation by enforcing strict access controls via reusable security directives, and verifying that critical or unnecessary files (like `readme.html`) are effectively blocked.

## Structured Document

This document guides you through integrating a centralized set of Nginx security rules into your site configuration and confirming the rules work correctly.

### ðŸ”’ Main Configuration

```nginx
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com.conf

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    root /var/www/example.com;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    # Include global security rules before PHP processing block
    include /etc/nginx/includes/nginx_security_directives.conf;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

    access_log /var/log/nginx/example.com.access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/example.com.error.log;
}
```

### Explanation of Contents

1. **Global Security Rules Inclusion:**

   * The directive `include /etc/nginx/includes/nginx_security_directives.conf;` imports all predefined security hardening rules.
   * Placing it **above** the PHP block ensures it's applied to all applicable paths, including direct access attempts to `.php` files or static files like `readme.html`.

2. **Verification Target:**

   * The `nginx_security_directives.conf` file might include:

     ```nginx
     location ~* /readme\.html$ { deny all; }
     ```
   * This rule blocks direct web access to the `readme.html` file if it exists.

---

### Best Practices

* **Keep security rules modular**: Use separate include files like `nginx_security_directives.conf` to apply common policies across multiple sites.
* **Include rules before PHP processing blocks**: This ensures static file protection isnâ€™t bypassed.
* **Always test configuration before reload**:

  ```bash
  sudo nginx -t
  sudo systemctl reload nginx
  ```
* **Audit security rules regularly**: As your site changes, ensure no new sensitive endpoints are unintentionally exposed.
* **Verify block rules with `curl` or browser**:

  ```bash
  curl -I https://example.com/readme.html
  ```

  * `403 Forbidden`: File exists and is blocked.
  * `404 Not Found`: File does not exist.

By integrating these steps, your server becomes more resilient against reconnaissance and common automated scans.
