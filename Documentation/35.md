# PHP-FPM: Increase File Descriptor and Core Dump Limits

## Purpose

To improve PHP-FPM's capacity for handling high-concurrency environments and enable crash debugging by increasing the maximum number of file descriptors (`rlimit_files`) and enabling core dumps (`rlimit_core`).

## Structured Document

### 1. Check Current PHP-FPM Process Limits

Use the following commands to identify the PHP-FPM master and worker process PIDs and check their current limits:

```bash
ps aux | grep php-fpm
cat /proc/<master process PID>/limits
cat /proc/<worker process PID>/limits
```

Look specifically at:

* **Max open files**
* **Max core file size**

---

### 2. Backup and Edit `php-fpm.conf`

Navigate to the PHP-FPM configuration directory and back up the existing configuration file:

```bash
cd /etc/php/8.3/fpm
sudo cp php-fpm.conf php-fpm.conf.bak
sudo nano php-fpm.conf
```

Uncomment or add the following lines to increase the limits:

```ini
rlimit_files = 32768
rlimit_core = unlimited
```

* `rlimit_files`: Sets the maximum number of file descriptors a PHP process can use.
* `rlimit_core`: Allows unlimited core file size for crash dumps.

---

### 3. Reload PHP-FPM

Reload the PHP-FPM service to apply the new configuration:

```bash
fpmr
```

Where `fpmr` is defined as:

```bash
alias fpmr='sudo systemctl reload php8.3-fpm'
```

---

### 4. Verify the Updated Limits

Re-run the following commands to confirm the new values are active:

```bash
ps aux | grep php-fpm
cat /proc/<master process PID>/limits
cat /proc/<worker process PID>/limits
```

Expected output should include:

* Max open files: `32768`
* Max core file size: `unlimited`

## Best Practices

* Always back up configuration files before making changes.
* Apply changes during scheduled maintenance to avoid service disruptions.
* Monitor system logs for PHP-FPM after applying new limits to ensure stability.
* Use `systemctl status php8.3-fpm` to check for any reload or config errors.
* Keep the limit values aligned with your systemâ€™s `ulimit` and OS capabilities.
