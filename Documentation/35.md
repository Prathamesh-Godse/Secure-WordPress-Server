## 🧠 PHP-FPM: Increase File Descriptor and Core Dump Limits

This section focuses on increasing PHP-FPM's resource limits by modifying the `php-fpm.conf` file. Raising the file descriptor limit helps with high-concurrency performance (e.g., when many users access your WordPress site), and enabling core dumps aids in debugging.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* Increase the maximum number of open files per PHP-FPM process (`rlimit_files`).
* Allow unlimited core dump generation (`rlimit_core`) for debugging PHP crashes.
* Ensure PHP can serve high traffic without running into resource bottlenecks.

---

### 🛠️ Steps to Modify PHP-FPM Limits

---

#### 🔍 Check Current PHP-FPM Process Limits

```bash
ps aux | grep php-fpm
```

* Get the PID of the **master process** and one of the **worker processes** (usually part of the `www` pool).

```bash
cat /proc/<master process PID>/limits
cat /proc/<pool www PID>/limits
```

* View the current file descriptor and core file size limits.

---

#### 🧱 Backup and Modify the `php-fpm.conf`

```bash
cd /etc/php/8.3/fpm
sudo cp php-fpm.conf php-fpm.conf.bak
sudo nano php-fpm.conf
```

Then find and **uncomment/modify** these lines:

```ini
rlimit_files = 32768
rlimit_core = unlimited
```

> 🔧 `rlimit_files`: Increases the number of file descriptors a PHP process can open.
> 🧩 `rlimit_core`: Enables full core dump file creation for crash diagnostics.

---

#### 🔄 Apply the New Limits

```bash
fpmr
```

This reloads PHP-FPM using your previously defined alias:

```bash
alias fpmr='sudo systemctl reload php8.3-fpm'
```

---

#### 🔁 Verify New Limits

```bash
ps aux | grep php-fpm
```

```bash
cat /proc/<master process PID>/limits
cat /proc/<pool www PID>/limits
```

You should now see updated values for:

* **Max open files**: `32768`
* **Max core file size**: `unlimited`

---

✅ **Result**: PHP-FPM is now optimized to handle more open connections and allows deeper debugging if needed.
