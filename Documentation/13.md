# File Access Time Optimization (`noatime`)

# Purpose

Improve filesystem performance by disabling file access time updates. This reduces unnecessary disk writes, particularly valuable on SSDs, read-heavy workloads, and CMS-driven servers.

# Structured Document

## 1. Access Time Options Overview

| Option     | Behavior                                                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atime`    | Updates the fileâ€™s access time on every read operation.          |
| `relatime` | Updates `atime` only if it is earlier than `mtime` or `ctime`.   |
| `noatime`  | Disables access time updates entirely. Highest performance gain. |

## 2. Check Current Disk and Mount Information

### Disk usage:

```bash
df -h
```

### Active mount options:

```bash
sudo cat /proc/mounts
```

Look for the `/` root filesystem and verify if `relatime` or `noatime` is in use.

---

## 3. Enable `noatime` in `/etc/fstab`

### Step 1: Open the file

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

### Step 2: Locate your root partition (usually formatted like this):

```fstab
UUID=xxxx-xxxx  /  ext4  defaults  0 1
```

### Step 3: Modify it to include `noatime`:

```fstab
UUID=xxxx-xxxx  /  ext4  defaults,noatime  0 1
```

> Replace `relatime` with `noatime` if present.

---

## 4. Apply the Configuration

### Reboot the server:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

## 5. Confirm `noatime` Is Active

After reboot, verify the mount settings:

```bash
sudo cat /proc/mounts | grep ' / '
```

You should see:

```
/dev/sda1 / ext4 rw,noatime,errors=remount-ro 0 0
```

This confirms `noatime` is applied.

# Best Practices

* Use `noatime` on performance-critical or read-intensive systems where access time metadata is not required.
* If using applications that rely on `atime` (e.g., some backup or mail tools), use `relatime` instead.
* Always back up `/etc/fstab` before making changes to avoid boot issues.
