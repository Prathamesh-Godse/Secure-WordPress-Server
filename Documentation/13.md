## 📁 File Access Time Optimization (`noatime`)

This section improves filesystem performance by disabling access time updates on files, which can be unnecessary and slow down disk operations—especially on servers.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* Improve disk I/O performance by avoiding frequent updates to file **access time (`atime`)** metadata.
* This is especially beneficial for:

  * Servers running CMS (like WordPress)
  * Read-heavy applications
  * SSDs or high-throughput workloads

### 🔍 Understanding `atime`, `noatime`, `relatime`

| Option     | Behavior                                                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atime`    | Updates the access timestamp every time a file is read.        |
| `relatime` | Updates `atime` only if it is earlier than `mtime` or `ctime`. |
| `noatime`  | **Does not update** access time at all. **Best performance**.  |

### 🛠️ Steps to Disable `atime` Updates (`noatime`)

#### 1. Check disk usage and mounted partitions:

```bash
df -h
```

#### 2. Review current mount options:

```bash
sudo cat /proc/mounts
```

#### 3. Edit `/etc/fstab` to add `noatime`:

```bash
cd /etc
sudo nano fstab
```

#### 4. Locate the line with the root partition (usually `/`) and modify it:

```fstab
UUID=xxxx-xxxx  /  ext4  defaults,noatime  0 1
```

> 💡 You might see `relatime` instead — replace it with `noatime`.

---

### 🔄 Apply the Changes

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### ✅ Confirm the Change After Reboot

```bash
sudo cat /proc/mounts | grep ' / '
```

You should see something like:

```
/dev/sda1 / ext4 rw,noatime,errors=remount-ro 0 0
```

This confirms that `noatime` is active and access time metadata won't be updated anymore.

### ⚠️ Caution

Avoid using `noatime` if your application explicitly relies on access time (e.g., some backup or mail systems).

### 1. 🔍 What is `df -h`?

`df` stands for **Disk Free** — it shows how much disk space is **used and available** on your mounted filesystems.

```bash
df -h
```

- `-h` means **human-readable** — it displays sizes in **MB, GB, etc.** instead of blocks.
    

**Sample output:**

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        50G   10G   38G  21% /
tmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm
```

- **Filesystem**: the device or partition.
    
- **Size**: total capacity.
    
- **Used**: space used.
    
- **Avail**: free space available.
    
- **Use%**: percentage used.
    
- **Mounted on**: mount point (e.g., `/`, `/boot`).

### 2. 🆔 What is a UUID?

**UUID** stands for **Universally Unique Identifier**.

In the context of Linux filesystems:

- A **UUID** is a unique ID assigned to each storage device or partition.
    
- It’s used in `/etc/fstab` to identify and mount partitions **reliably**, even if device names (`/dev/sda1`, etc.) change.
    

> Unlike `/dev/sda1`, which can change depending on how drives are detected, UUIDs are **stable and persistent**.

**How to find a partition’s UUID:**

```bash
sudo blkid
```

**Example output:**

```
/dev/sda1: UUID="b3f3c87e-a62f-403e-9ef1-334f593ab54d" TYPE="ext4"
```

You can then use this UUID in your `/etc/fstab`:

```fstab
UUID=b3f3c87e-a62f-403e-9ef1-334f593ab54d / ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1
```

This ensures the correct partition always mounts at the correct location during boot.
