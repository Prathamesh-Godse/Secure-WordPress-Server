## 🔧 Integrating WP Super Cache NGINX Rules into Site Configuration

This process replaces the existing `location / {}` block with the more dynamic WP Super Cache rules by **commenting out** the old block and **including** the cache exclusions from a centralized file.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Confirm the Cache Exclude File Path

```bash
readlink -f wp_super_cache_excludes.conf
```

> 🧭 This ensures you're referencing the absolute path (e.g., `/etc/nginx/includes/wp_super_cache_excludes.conf`) correctly in the site config.

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Verify the `location /` Directive

```bash
cd /etc/nginx

sudo cat includes/wp_super_cache_excludes.conf | grep "location /"
sudo cat sites-available/prathameshgodse.com.conf | grep "location /"
```

> These checks ensure that you're not duplicating or conflicting with the `location /` block when including the WP Super Cache logic.

---

### ✏️ Step 3: Modify the Site Configuration

```bash
sudo nano sites-available/prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

Inside the file:

* **Comment out** the existing `location / {}` block (usually handles static file routing or `try_files` logic).
* **Before** the `location ~ \.php$ {}` block, **add** the following line:

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/wp_super_cache_excludes.conf;
```

> Ensure the include is outside any other `location` blocks and not nested improperly.

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Reload and Restart NGINX

```bash
ngt   # Likely: sudo systemctl reload nginx
ngr   # Likely: sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

> Reload applies config changes without downtime. Restart fully resets NGINX.

---

### ✅ Result

* The default `location /` block is now **replaced** by WP Super Cache logic.
* NGINX uses `try_files` to serve cached pages if available, and falls back to WordPress when necessary.
* Cache is **skipped** intelligently for logged-in users, POST requests, and specific paths like `/wp-admin/`.
