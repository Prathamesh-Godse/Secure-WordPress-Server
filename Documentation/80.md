# Integrating WP Super Cache NGINX Rules into Site Configuration

## Purpose

To replace the existing NGINX `location / {}` block with WP Super Cache rules by commenting out the original block and including a centralized cache exclusion configuration. This enables efficient serving of cached pages while properly bypassing cache when needed.

## Structured Document

### Step 1: Confirm the Cache Exclude File Path

Verify the absolute path of the WP Super Cache exclusions file to ensure correct referencing:

```bash
readlink -f wp_super_cache_excludes.conf
```

Use the full absolute path (e.g., `/etc/nginx/includes/wp_super_cache_excludes.conf`) when including the file in your site configuration.

---

### Step 2: Verify Existing `location /` Directives

Check for existing `location /` blocks in both the exclusions file and the site configuration:

```bash
cd /etc/nginx

sudo cat includes/wp_super_cache_excludes.conf | grep "location /"
sudo cat sites-available/prathameshgodse.com.conf | grep "location /"
```

This step ensures no conflicting or duplicate `location /` blocks exist.

---

### Step 3: Modify the Site Configuration File

Open your site config for editing:

```bash
sudo nano sites-available/prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

Inside the file:

* **Comment out** the existing `location / {}` block that handles static file routing or contains `try_files` logic.
* **Add** the following line **outside** any `location` blocks and **before** the PHP location block (`location ~ \.php$ {}`):

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/wp_super_cache_excludes.conf;
```

Ensure the `include` directive is not nested within other blocks improperly.

---

### Step 4: Reload and Restart NGINX

Apply the changes by reloading and restarting NGINX:

```bash
ngt   # Alias for sudo systemctl reload nginx
ngr   # Alias for sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

* Reload (`ngt`) applies configuration changes gracefully without downtime.
* Restart (`ngr`) fully restarts the NGINX service, useful if reload fails or for full reset.

---

## Best Practices

* Always back up your configuration files before making changes.

* Test NGINX configuration syntax before reloading:

  ```bash
  sudo nginx -t
  ```

* Validate site functionality after changes to confirm caching works as expected.

* Keep the cache exclusions include file maintained separately for ease of updates.
