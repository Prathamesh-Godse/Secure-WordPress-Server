## 🛠️ Checking PHP File Count for OPCache Configuration

When tuning the `opcache.max_accelerated_files` directive in your PHP-FPM pool configuration, it’s important to know how many PHP files your application uses. The following steps help determine that and validate your pool config.

---

### 📁 Step 1: Navigate to Your Web Root Directory

```bash
cd /var/www/
```

This is the base directory where your website files are stored.

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Count the Number of PHP Files

```bash
sudo find . -type f -print | grep php | wc -l
```

* `find . -type f -print` – lists all files recursively.
* `grep php` – filters files that contain “php” in their name.
* `wc -l` – counts the number of such files.

> 🔢 **Purpose:** Helps estimate a suitable value for `opcache.max_accelerated_files`.

### 📄 Step 3: Review Your PHP-FPM Pool Configuration

```bash
cd /etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d
sudo cat prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

This will show the current OPCache and pool-specific settings applied for your domain.

### 🔁 Repeat PHP File Count (Optional)

```bash
cd /var/www/
sudo find . -type f -print | grep php | wc -l
```

You may repeat this to re-confirm or after deploying changes.
