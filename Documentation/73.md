# Checking PHP File Count for OPCache Configuration

## Purpose

To estimate the appropriate value for the `opcache.max_accelerated_files` directive by determining the total number of PHP files used in your application. This helps ensure PHP scripts are efficiently cached by OPCache.

## Structured Document

### Step 1: Navigate to the Web Root Directory

```bash
cd /var/www/
```

This is the primary directory where web application files are stored. Adjust the path if your site is located elsewhere.

### Step 2: Count the Number of PHP Files

Use the following command to get a rough count of all PHP-related files:

```bash
sudo find . -type f -print | grep php | wc -l
```

**Explanation of the command:**

* `find . -type f -print` — Recursively lists all files.
* `grep php` — Filters for files that contain “php” in their names.
* `wc -l` — Counts the number of matching files.

This estimate helps determine the appropriate value for:

```ini
opcache.max_accelerated_files = [estimated_file_count]
```

Refer to the official PHP manual for detailed guidance:
[PHP Manual – opcache.max\_accelerated\_files](https://www.php.net/manual/en/opcache.configuration.php#ini.opcache.max-accelerated-files)

### Step 3: Review the PHP-FPM Pool Configuration

Navigate to the PHP-FPM configuration directory and inspect the specific pool configuration file:

```bash
cd /etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/
sudo cat prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

This file should include your existing OPCache-related settings. Review the current value of `opcache.max_accelerated_files` and update it if necessary based on the file count.

---

### Step 4: (Optional) Recount PHP Files After Changes

If you've added or removed PHP files, re-run the count:

```bash
cd /var/www/
sudo find . -type f -print | grep php | wc -l
```

Repeat this step periodically, especially after major deployments, to keep your OPCache configuration optimized.

## Best Practices

* Always match or slightly exceed the actual PHP file count when setting `opcache.max_accelerated_files`.
* Avoid setting the value too low, as it will limit caching and degrade performance.
* Avoid setting the value excessively high, as it can waste memory unnecessarily.
* Recount PHP files after large deployments or refactoring.
* Monitor OPCache performance using tools like `opcache_get_status()` or PHP monitoring dashboards.
