# SSH Setup & Maintenance for Remote Devices

# Purpose

To establish and maintain secure SSH access to remote devices, ensuring proper directory setup, key usage, host verification, and troubleshooting common identity issues.

# Structured Document

## 1. Create `.ssh` Directory (If Not Already Present)

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p .ssh
```

* The `-p` flag ensures no error is thrown if the `.ssh` directory already exists.
* This directory contains critical SSH configuration and identity files such as `known_hosts`, keys, and optional SSH configuration.

---

## 2. Connect to a Remote Device

```bash
# Option 1: Password-based authentication
ssh root@<REMOTE_DEVICE_IP>

# Option 2: SSH key-based authentication
ssh -i ~/path/to/private_key user@<REMOTE_DEVICE_IP>
```

* Replace `<REMOTE_DEVICE_IP>` with the IP address of the remote machine.
* If using a private key, ensure it has proper permissions:

  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/path/to/private_key
  ```

---

## 3. Exit the Remote Session

```bash
exit
```

* This command terminates the SSH session and returns control to the local terminal.

---

## 4. Inspect `.ssh` Directory

```bash
ls .ssh
cd .ssh
ls -la
```

* Common files to expect in this directory:

  * `known_hosts`: Tracks fingerprints of previously accessed hosts.
  * `id_rsa` / `id_ed25519`: Private SSH key.
  * `id_rsa.pub`: Corresponding public key.
  * `config`: User-defined SSH configuration settings.

---

## 5. View Stored SSH Host Keys

```bash
cat known_hosts
cat known_hosts.old
```

* These files are used to verify the identity of known hosts and protect against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

---

## 6. Remove Outdated or Invalid Host Keys

```bash
ssh-keygen -R <REMOTE_DEVICE_IP>
```

* This command deletes the matching entry from `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
* Useful when:

  * The remote server has reinstalled or changed its SSH host key.
  * You receive warnings such as:

    ```
    REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!
    ```

# Best Practices

* Always use SSH key-based authentication instead of passwords for better security.
* Set proper file permissions (`600` for private keys, `644` for public keys).
* Regularly review `known_hosts` to remove stale or untrusted entries.
* Avoid logging in as `root` directly; use a normal user with `sudo` privileges.
* Use SSH config (`~/.ssh/config`) to simplify repeated connections.
* Maintain backups of important SSH keys in a secure, encrypted location.
* Enable and monitor SSH logs to detect unauthorized access attempts.
