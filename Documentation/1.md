Here's a properly documented and explained version of your SSH steps with context:

---

## üîê SSH Setup & Maintenance for Remote Devices

### ‚úÖ 1. Create `.ssh` Directory (If Not Already Present)

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p .ssh
```

* The `-p` flag avoids errors if `.ssh` already exists.
* `.ssh` stores SSH-related files like `known_hosts`, keys, and configs.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Connect to Remote Device

```bash
# Option 1: Using password authentication
ssh root@<REMOTE_DEVICE_IP>

# Option 2: Using SSH key
ssh -i ~/path/to/private_key user@<REMOTE_DEVICE_IP>
```

* Replace `<REMOTE_DEVICE_IP>` with the IP of the remote device.
* If using key-based login, ensure correct permissions on the private key (`chmod 600`).

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Exit Remote Device

```bash
exit
```

* This returns you to your local machine shell.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Inspect `.ssh` Directory

```bash
ls .ssh
cd .ssh
ls -la
```

* Look for files like:

  * `known_hosts` ‚Äî stores the fingerprints of previously accessed hosts
  * `id_rsa` / `id_ed25519` ‚Äî private key
  * `id_rsa.pub` ‚Äî public key
  * `config` ‚Äî custom SSH settings

---

### ‚úÖ 5. View Stored SSH Host Keys

```bash
cat known_hosts
cat known_hosts.old
```

* These files help prevent **MITM (Man-In-The-Middle)** attacks by verifying host identities.

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Remove Host Key if Changed or Invalid

```bash
ssh-keygen -R <REMOTE_DEVICE_IP>
```

* This command:

  * Removes the old host key entry from `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
  * Useful when:

    * The remote server reinstalled or changed its SSH key
    * You get errors like:
      **"REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!"**

---

Would you like a script or `.ssh/config` file to manage multiple servers more easily with key-based auth, aliases, or custom ports?
