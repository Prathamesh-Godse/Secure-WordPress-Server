# `basic_settings.conf`

## Purpose

To configure foundational performance and security parameters in the Nginx configuration. These settings improve I/O efficiency, control HTTP header exposure, and optimize resource handling across servers with multiple domains and MIME types.

## Structured Document

```nginx

## BASIC SETTINGS
##
charset utf-8;
sendfile on;
sendfile_max_chunk 512k;
tcp_nopush on;
tcp_nodelay on;

default_type application/octet-stream;
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation

* `charset utf-8;`
  Sets UTF-8 as the default character encoding to ensure proper display of content across web clients.

* `sendfile on;`
  Enables zero-copy file transfers from disk to socket, enhancing throughput for serving static files.

* `sendfile_max_chunk 512k;`
  Restricts each chunk transferred using `sendfile` to 512 KB, helping prevent I/O thread blocking.

* `tcp_nopush on;`
  Sends HTTP response headers and body in fewer packets, optimizing performance when `sendfile` is enabled.

* `tcp_nodelay on;`
  Disables Nagle’s algorithm to minimize latency by sending small packets immediately.

* `server_tokens off;`
  Disables the Nginx version number in responses, reducing information leakage.

* `more_clear_headers 'Server';`
  Removes the `Server` response header entirely; requires `headers-more-nginx-module`.

* `more_clear_headers 'X-Powered';`
  Removes technology stack indicators like `X-Powered-By` to limit exposure.

* `server_name_in_redirect off;`
  Ensures that redirects use the requested host instead of the `server_name`, preventing hostname leakage.

* `server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;`
  Adjusts the hash bucket size for server names to handle more domains without hash collisions.

* `variables_hash_max_size 2048;`
  Sets the maximum size of the hash table for Nginx variables, ensuring performance in large configs.

* `types_hash_max_size 2048;`
  Configures MIME type hash table size, accommodating a wider set of MIME definitions efficiently.

* `include /etc/nginx/mime.types;`
  Loads a file that maps extensions to MIME types (e.g., `.html`, `.png`).

* `default_type application/octet-stream;`
  Specifies the default MIME type when a file’s type cannot be determined, treating it as a binary stream.

## Best Practices

* Always disable `server_tokens` and clear headers exposing internal details to enhance security.
* Adjust hash sizes (`server_names`, `variables`, `types`) based on the scale and complexity of your server.
* Use `sendfile`, `tcp_nopush`, and `tcp_nodelay` together to optimize file delivery and latency.
* Keep the `mime.types` file updated to ensure correct content-type mapping.
* Test configuration changes in a staging environment before deploying to production.
