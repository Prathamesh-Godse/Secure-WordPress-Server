## üß© Isolated PHP-FPM Pool for `example.com` with Custom Logging

This section ensures `example.com` uses a dedicated PHP-FPM pool and error log file, with secure ownership and separation from other sites.

---

### ü™µ Step 1: Create & Secure the PHP-FPM Log File

```bash
sudo touch /var/log/fpm-php.example.com.log
sudo chown example:www-data /var/log/fpm-php.example.com.log
sudo chmod 660 /var/log/fpm-php.example.com.log
```

* Creates a domain-specific log file for PHP errors.
* Ensures it's writable only by the `example` user and `www-data` group.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Reload PHP-FPM and Verify Socket

```bash
fpmr
sudo grep "listen = /" /etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/example.com.conf
```

* Reloads PHP-FPM after config changes.
* Verifies that the socket path (e.g., `/run/php/php8.3-fpm-example.com.sock`) is correct.

---

### üåê Step 3: Update NGINX Site Config to Use the Correct Socket

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
sudo nano example.com.conf
```

Make sure this line inside the `location ~ \.php$` block is updated:

```nginx
fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm-example.com.sock;
```

---

### üîÅ Step 4: Test & Reload NGINX

```bash
ngt   # Alias for: sudo nginx -t
ngr   # Alias for: sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### ‚úÖ Result

* The domain `example.com` now uses its own PHP-FPM pool and logs.
* Errors for this site are logged separately.
* File permissions follow the principle of least privilege.
