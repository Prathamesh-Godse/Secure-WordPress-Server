# `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` (HTTP Block)

## Purpose

Defines global HTTP-level configuration for Nginx, organizing core settings, optimizations, and virtual host definitions via modular includes.

## Structured Document

```nginx
http {
	## Basic Settings
	include /etc/nginx/includes/basic_settings.conf;

	## Buffer Settings
	include /etc/nginx/includes/buffers.conf;

	## Timeout Settings
	include /etc/nginx/includes/timeouts.conf;

	## File Handle Cache Settings
	include /etc/nginx/includes/file_handle_cache.conf;

	## Logging
	access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;

	## Compression
	include /etc/nginx/includes/gzip.conf;
	include /etc/nginx/includes/brotli.conf;

	## Virtual Host Configs
	include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
	include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
}
```

### Configuration Breakdown

#### http Block

Defines the start of HTTP-specific configurations, affecting all server blocks under it.

#### Basic Settings

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/basic_settings.conf;
```

Loads fundamental directives like `sendfile`, `tcp_nopush`, `server_tokens off`, and default MIME types.

#### Buffer Settings

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/buffers.conf;
```

Optimizes request buffering, header size limits, and post body size handling.

#### Timeout Settings

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/timeouts.conf;
```

Controls timeouts for keep-alive, client body read, and connection timeouts.

#### File Handle Cache

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/file_handle_cache.conf;
```

Caches open file descriptors and paths to reduce disk I/O on frequently accessed files.

#### Access Logging

```nginx
access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
```

Records all HTTP requests for monitoring and debugging.

#### Compression

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/gzip.conf;
include /etc/nginx/includes/brotli.conf;
```

Enables Gzip and Brotli compression for reducing response size and improving load times.

#### Virtual Host Configurations

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
```

Loads domain or project-specific configurations modularly for scalable hosting.

## Best Practices

* **Modularize Includes**: Keep each functional concern (buffers, timeouts, compression) in separate files for readability and reusability.
* **Test Before Reloading**: Always validate the configuration with `nginx -t` before applying it.
* **Disable Unused Modules**: Avoid loading modules or settings not used in your environment.
* **Limit Logs in Production**: Rotate or minimize access logging if not needed to reduce disk usage.
* **Enable Brotli and Gzip selectively**: Apply to static assets and skip for already compressed files like images or videos.
* **Maintain Consistent Directory Layout**: Use `sites-available` and `sites-enabled` for better configuration management.
