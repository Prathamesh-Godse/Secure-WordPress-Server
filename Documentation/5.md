## üî• Firewall Configuration: UFW + VPS Inbound Rules

This section documents how to **configure UFW firewall rules** based on whether the host already has it enabled, and how to adjust **VPS-level inbound rules** for improved security and service availability.

---

### üß≠ Purpose

* Allow only necessary incoming traffic (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH).
* Deny all other unauthorized connections.
* Secure server access while keeping web and SSH services reachable.

## üß± Part 1: Configuring UFW (Ubuntu Firewall)

---

### üîÑ Case 1: UFW Already Enabled by Host

Check current status:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

Allow essential services:

```bash
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https/tcp
sudo ufw allow https/udp
```

Reload to apply:

```bash
sudo ufw reload
```

Verify rules:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

Reboot the server:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Reconnect via SSH:

```bash
ssh 01
sudo ufw status verbose
```

---

### ‚ûï Case 2: UFW Not Yet Enabled

Check status:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

Set default policies:

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```
What it does:

This sets the default policy for incoming connections to DENY.

It means:

"Block all incoming traffic unless explicitly allowed."

Why it's important:

It's a safety-first rule: only services you specifically allow (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, SSH) will be accessible.

Helps prevent unauthorized access or scanning from the internet.

```bash
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```
What it does:

Sets the default policy for outgoing connections to ALLOW.

It means:

"Allow this server to make outbound connections to the internet (e.g., updates, DNS, APIs, etc.)."

Why it's important:

Most services running on your server (like package managers, system updates, or WordPress plugins) need to initiate outgoing connections.

Allowing outgoing traffic keeps everything functional without restrictions.

Allow necessary services:

```bash
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https/tcp
sudo ufw allow https/udp
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

Enable UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Review rules:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

Reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Reconnect via SSH:

```bash
ssh 01
```

## üåê Part 2: VPS Control Panel ‚Äì Inbound Rules

Update your **VPS provider's firewall** or **cloud security group** to only allow:

1. ‚úÖ **ICMP** ‚Äî for ping/latency tests.
2. ‚úÖ **SSH (port 22)** ‚Äî allow from **your IP only**.
3. ‚úÖ **HTTPS (TCP port 443)** ‚Äî allow from **anywhere**.
4. ‚úÖ **HTTPS (UDP port 443)** ‚Äî for **QUIC/HTTP3**.
5. ‚úÖ **UDP** ‚Äî if required for any other services.

**Delete all other default allow rules.**

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Always test SSH access before enabling UFW.
* Use `ufw logging on` for monitoring dropped/allowed packets.
* Limit SSH access to your IP in the VPS provider panel for extra safety.
* Avoid `ufw allow 443` without specifying protocol unless necessary.
