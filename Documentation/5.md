# Firewall Configuration: UFW + VPS Inbound Rules

## Purpose

To secure the server by configuring local (UFW) and cloud-level (VPS provider) firewalls. The goal is to allow only essential services such as HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH while blocking all unauthorized traffic.

## Structured Document

### Part 1: Configuring UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Ubuntu

#### Case 1: UFW Already Enabled by Host

Check UFW status:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

Allow essential incoming services:

```bash
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https/tcp
sudo ufw allow https/udp
```

Reload firewall rules:

```bash
sudo ufw reload
```

Verify rules again:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

Reboot the server:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Reconnect via SSH:

```bash
ssh 01
sudo ufw status verbose
```

---

#### Case 2: UFW Not Yet Enabled

Check status:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

Set default policies:

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```

* Denies all incoming traffic unless explicitly allowed.
* Reduces the risk of unauthorized access or network scanning.

```bash
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

* Allows all outgoing traffic initiated by the server (e.g., updates, DNS, APIs).
* Keeps services functional and connected.

Allow essential services:

```bash
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https/tcp
sudo ufw allow https/udp
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

Enable the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Review the configured rules:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

Reboot the server to apply all changes:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Reconnect:

```bash
ssh 01
```

### Part 2: Configuring Inbound Rules in VPS Control Panel

Adjust your cloud provider’s firewall or security group settings to allow only essential traffic:

1. **ICMP (Ping)** — allow from anywhere for connectivity testing.
2. **SSH (TCP 22)** — restrict to your specific IP for secure access.
3. **HTTPS (TCP 443)** — allow from anywhere for web access.
4. **HTTPS (UDP 443)** — allow from anywhere if using QUIC/HTTP3.
5. **Other UDP Ports** — allow only if needed by specific services.

> Remove all other default "allow all" inbound rules to harden security.

## Best Practices

* Always verify SSH access using a separate terminal before enabling or modifying UFW rules.

* Enable logging with:

  ```bash
  sudo ufw logging on
  ```

  to track blocked or allowed traffic.

* Limit SSH access to your IP address in the VPS control panel whenever possible.

* When allowing port `443`, specify protocol (`tcp` or `udp`) to avoid unnecessary exposure.

* Regularly audit both UFW and VPS-level firewall rules to remove outdated or unused entries.

* Use aliases in your SSH config (`~/.ssh/config`) to quickly reconnect after reboot or rule updates.
