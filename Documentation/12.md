## üì∂ TCP Congestion Control

TCP Congestion Control algorithms manage the rate at which data is sent across the network to avoid overwhelming the receiver or intermediate routers.

Linux supports several congestion control algorithms, and selecting the right one can significantly improve network performance for your workload.

---

### üß≠ Purpose

* Query and manage which TCP congestion control algorithms are available and in use.
* Optimize network throughput and latency.
* Improve resilience during packet loss or network congestion.

---

### üîç View Available Congestion Control Algorithms

```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
```

**Example output:**

```
net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control = cubic reno bbr
```

* `cubic`: Default on most Linux systems; great for general-purpose use.
* `reno`: Older, simpler algorithm.
* `bbr`: Modern Google-developed algorithm that improves latency and throughput in many cases.

### üîß View the Currently Active Algorithm

```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control
```

**Example output:**

```
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = cubic
```

This tells you which algorithm is currently **in use**.

---

### üîÅ (Optional) Change TCP Congestion Control Algorithm

You can temporarily switch to another algorithm (e.g., BBR) using:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr
```

To make it **persistent** across reboots, add it to your sysctl overrides file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/custom_overrides.conf
```

Add:

```ini
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bbr
```

Then reload sysctl:

```bash
sudo sysctl --system
```

---

### üì¶ Enabling BBR (if not available)

If `bbr` is not listed under `tcp_available_congestion_control`, you can enable it with:

```bash
echo 'tcp_bbr' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
sudo modprobe tcp_bbr
```

Then confirm again:

```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
```

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

* **Use `cubic`**: If unsure, it‚Äôs a stable default.
* **Use `bbr`**: Ideal for high-latency or high-bandwidth links (like long-distance VPS traffic).
* **Avoid `reno`** unless explicitly required.

### 1. `sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control`

üß† **What it does:**

- This command queries the **kernel's list of available TCP congestion control algorithms** on your system.
    
- It reads the value of the `net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control` kernel parameter.
    

‚úÖ **Purpose:**

To see **which congestion control algorithms** your Linux kernel supports.

---

### 2. `net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control = reno cubic`

üìÑ **What this output means:**

- It shows that **two algorithms are currently available** for use:
    
    - `reno`: A classic algorithm based on loss detection; conservative.
        
    - `cubic`: The default in modern Linux kernels; optimized for high-speed, high-latency networks.
        

‚úÖ **Interpretation:**

Your kernel supports switching between these two congestion control strategies depending on your network needs.

---

### 3. `sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control`

üß† **What it does:**

- This command queries **which TCP congestion control algorithm is currently in use** by the system.
    
- It reads the value of the `net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control` kernel parameter.
    

‚úÖ **Purpose:**

To identify the **active algorithm** that new TCP connections will use.

---

### 4. `net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = cubic`

üìÑ **What this output means:**

- The **current algorithm being used** by the system is `cubic`.
    

‚úÖ **Cubic characteristics:**

- Default for Linux since kernel 2.6.19.
    
- Designed for **fast, modern networks** with higher latency.
    
- Increases throughput more aggressively than `reno`, making it a better fit for servers and cloud environments.

|Algorithm|Key Feature|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|`reno`|Conservative, linear growth|Legacy or compatibility|
|`cubic`|Aggressive, scalable performance|Default for modern Linux|
