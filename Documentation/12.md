# TCP Congestion Control

# Purpose

To monitor, manage, and optimize the TCP congestion control algorithm used by the Linux kernel for outbound and inbound TCP traffic. Choosing the right algorithm can reduce latency, improve throughput, and increase stability under varying network conditions.

# Structured Document

## 1. View Available TCP Congestion Control Algorithms

```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
```

**Example output:**

```
net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control = cubic reno bbr
```

* `cubic`: Default on most modern Linux systems; optimized for high-throughput networks.
* `reno`: Legacy algorithm; conservative with bandwidth.
* `bbr`: Designed for improved throughput and low latency, particularly over high-latency paths.

## 2. Check the Currently Active Algorithm

```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control
```

**Example output:**

```
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = cubic
```

This identifies the active congestion control algorithm being used for all new TCP connections.

## 3. Change the Congestion Control Algorithm (Optional)

### Temporary Change:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr
```

### Persistent Change:

Edit your sysctl overrides:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/custom_overrides.conf
```

Add the following:

```ini
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bbr
```

Apply the change:

```bash
sudo sysctl --system
```

---

## 4. Enable BBR if Not Available

If `bbr` is missing from the available algorithms:

```bash
echo 'tcp_bbr' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
sudo modprobe tcp_bbr
```

Re-check availability:

```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
```

# Best Practices

* Use `cubic` for general workloads; it is stable and default in most distributions.
* Use `bbr` for improved performance on high-latency or high-throughput links such as cloud VPS or global services.
* Avoid `reno` unless needed for compatibility or specific legacy use cases.
* Test the algorithm's impact under real traffic to validate performance improvements before applying system-wide.

| Algorithm | Description                                  | Recommended Use Case                             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `reno`    | Simple and conservative; linear growth       | Legacy systems, compatibility                    |
| `cubic`   | Default in Linux; scalable, modern           | General-purpose, high-speed LAN/WAN              |
| `bbr`     | Google-developed; resilient under congestion | High-latency, high-bandwidth, cloud environments |
