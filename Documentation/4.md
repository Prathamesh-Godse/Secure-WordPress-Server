# SSH Host Alias & Server Maintenance

# Purpose

To streamline SSH connections using host aliases in the local configuration file and ensure server stability and security through routine updates, upgrades, and system cleanup.

# Structured Document

## 1. Set Up SSH Host Alias (On Local Machine)

```bash
cd
nano .ssh/config
```

* Add the following configuration, replacing `<user name>` with the appropriate username:

```ini
Host 01
    Hostname 95.179.129.251
    User <user name>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/server-01-keys
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 120
```

### Explanation:

* `Host 01`: Custom alias used in SSH commands (e.g., `ssh 01`).
* `Hostname`: IP address or domain of the remote server.
* `User`: Remote login user.
* `IdentityFile`: Path to the private key used for authentication.
* `ServerAliveInterval`: Interval (in seconds) to send keep-alive messages.
* `ServerAliveCountMax`: Maximum allowed missed responses before terminating the session.

### Usage:

```bash
ssh 01
```

* This command uses the configuration block labeled `Host 01` to initiate a connection.

## 2. Perform System Updates & Cleanup (On Remote Server)

Once connected to the server, run the following commands in sequence:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

* Refreshes the list of available packages and their versions.

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

* Installs the latest versions of installed packages.

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

* Cleans up unused packages and dependencies.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

* Reboots the system to apply updates that require a restart (e.g., kernel updates).

# Best Practices

* Use descriptive SSH aliases such as `dev`, `prod`, `web01`, or `db01` for clarity and efficiency.
* Maintain `~/.ssh/config` across devices using secure, private version control (e.g., encrypted Git repositories).
* Implement periodic or automated updates using tools like `unattended-upgrades` on Debian-based systems.
* Apply updates during planned maintenance windows to avoid unexpected downtimes.
* Always verify SSH access works after alias configuration and system updates.
* Use `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax` to reduce disconnections during idle SSH sessions.
* Perform cleanup with `apt autoremove` regularly to conserve disk space and minimize package conflicts.
