## ðŸ§© SSH Host Alias & Server Maintenance

This section focuses on **streamlining SSH access** using a custom host alias in your local `.ssh/config`, and running **essential server updates** to keep your system secure and efficient.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

* Simplify SSH connections by assigning a short alias (like `ssh 01`) to a server.
* Configure persistent keep-alive settings to avoid dropped connections.
* Perform regular OS updates, upgrades, and cleanup for optimal performance and security.

---

### ðŸ”§ Setting Up SSH Host Alias (Local Machine)

```bash
cd 
nano .ssh/config
```

Add the following entry (modify `<user name>` appropriately):

```ini
Host 01
    Hostname 95.179.129.251
    User <user name>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/server-01-keys
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 120
```

* `Host 01`: alias to use for this server (`ssh 01`).
* `Hostname`: your serverâ€™s IP or domain.
* `User`: the remote username.
* `IdentityFile`: the private key to use.
* `ServerAliveInterval`: sends a keep-alive every 60s.
* `ServerAliveCountMax`: allows up to 120 missed intervals before disconnecting.

Now you can connect using:

```bash
ssh 01
```

---

### ðŸ§¹ Performing System Updates & Cleanup (Remote Server)

Once connected to the server using the alias:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

* Updates the package index.

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

* Installs the latest versions of all upgradable packages.

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

* Removes unused dependencies and libraries.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

* Reboots the server to apply any kernel or system-level changes.

---

### âœ… Best Practices

* Use meaningful host aliases (e.g., `dev`, `prod`, `web01`) in `~/.ssh/config`.
* Store SSH config in version control (privately) for team consistency.
* Schedule regular system updates or use automation tools like `unattended-upgrades`.
* Always reboot after kernel upgrades to complete patching.
