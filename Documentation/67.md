### ðŸ”’ Restricting MySQL Privileges & Disabling REST API in WordPress

You've just taken **two strong WordPress hardening steps**. Here's a summary of what you're doing and why:

---

### âœ… 1. **MySQL User Privilege Restriction**

You're reducing the database user's access from full permissions to only essential CRUD operations:

```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON prathameshgodse_com.* FROM '<db_user>'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON prathameshgodse_com.* TO '<db_user>'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

| Action                                   | Purpose                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **REVOKE ALL**                           | Removes all elevated capabilities (like DROP, ALTER, GRANT, etc.).          |
| **GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE** | Limits to basic operations used by WordPress to display and update content. |
| **SECURITY GAINED**                      | Even if WordPress is compromised, the attacker canâ€™t drop or alter tables.  |

âœ… Confirmed via:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR '<db_user>'@'localhost';
```

---

### âœ… 2. **Disable REST API Plugin**

By installing and activating a plugin like **"Disable REST API"**, you block unauthenticated access to:

```
/wp-json/
```

This is useful when:

* You're **not using REST-based plugins**, headless CMS, or API clients.
* You want to prevent **info leakage** (e.g., usernames, theme names, plugin details).

---

### ðŸ“Œ Plugin Steps Recap:

1. Install **Disable REST API**.
2. Activate it.
3. Go to **Settings > Disable REST API**.
4. Confirm that REST is restricted for anonymous users.
