# WordPress Security: MySQL Privilege Restriction & REST API Hardening

## Purpose

To enhance the security posture of a WordPress installation by limiting MySQL user privileges and disabling the unauthenticated REST API, reducing the attack surface and minimizing potential damage in case of compromise.

## Structured Document

### Main Configuration

```sql
-- Step 1: Revoke all privileges
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON prathameshgodse_com.* FROM '<db_user>'@'localhost';

-- Step 2: Grant only essential CRUD permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON prathameshgodse_com.* TO '<db_user>'@'localhost';

-- Step 3: Apply changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- Step 4: Verify applied permissions
SHOW GRANTS FOR '<db_user>'@'localhost';
```

This SQL block ensures the database user account WordPress uses is restricted to only the operations it actually requires.

| Operation                              | Explanation                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES`                | Removes all existing permissions from the database user.                   |
| `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` | Provides only the permissions needed by WordPress during runtime.          |
| `FLUSH PRIVILEGES`                     | Forces MySQL to reload privilege tables, applying the changes immediately. |
| `SHOW GRANTS`                          | Allows verification of current permissions for the specified user.         |

### REST API Deactivation (Plugin-Based)

To eliminate unauthenticated exposure of WordPress data via the REST API:

**Steps**:

1. Go to the WordPress admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Plugins > Add New**.
3. Search for **“Disable REST API”**.
4. Install and activate the plugin.
5. Go to **Settings > Disable REST API**.
6. Ensure that only authenticated users are allowed access to `/wp-json/`.

| Feature                      | Benefit                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| REST API disabled            | Prevents data leaks from public REST endpoints.                  |
| Protects against enumeration | Reduces risk of exposing usernames, themes, or plugin metadata.  |
| Safe for non-API use cases   | No disruption if not using AJAX-based or REST API-based plugins. |

## Best Practices

* **Always assign least privilege** to MySQL users—WordPress rarely needs full access rights.
* **Disable unused interfaces** like the REST API if your installation does not explicitly require them.
* **Verify plugin compatibility** when disabling REST API, especially if using contact forms, front-end editors, or third-party integrations.
* **Backup before making changes** to database permissions.
* **Review REST API exposure periodically**, especially after installing new plugins or changing themes.
