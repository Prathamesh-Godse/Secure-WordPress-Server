# Setting Up Redis Server for WordPress Object Caching (PHP 8.3)

## Purpose

To install, configure, and integrate Redis as an object caching backend for WordPress running on PHP 8.3, improving site performance through fast in-memory caching.

## Structured Document

### Step 1: Install Redis and PHP Extension

* Update package lists and upgrade existing packages.
* Install Redis server and the PHP Redis extension:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install redis-server php8.3-redis
```

* This ensures both Redis service and PHP integration module are available.

---

### Step 2: Verify Redis is Running

* Check Redis service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status redis-server
```

* Review Redis server logs for errors:

```bash
cd /var/log/
sudo cat redis/redis-server.log
```

* Confirm Redis is active and error-free before proceeding.

---

### Step 3: Improve Redis Memory Handling (Overcommit Setting)

* Create a sysctl config to allow Redis to allocate memory flexibly:

```bash
cd /etc/sysctl.d/
sudo nano 11-redis.conf
```

* Add the following line:

```conf
vm.overcommit_memory = 1
```

* This prevents out-of-memory errors by permitting Redis to allocate more memory than the system estimates.

* Reboot the system to apply the setting:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

* After reboot, verify Redis is running properly again.

---

### Step 4: Configure Redis Memory and Eviction Policy

* Backup the existing Redis config:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/redis/redis.conf /etc/redis/redis.conf.bak
```

* Edit Redis config to limit memory and enable LRU eviction:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

* Locate and set:

```conf
maxmemory 256mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

* This limits Redis memory to 256 MB and removes least recently used keys when full.

* Restart Redis to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart redis-server
```

---

### Step 5: Integrate Redis with WordPress

* Edit the WordPress configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/example.com/public_html/wp-config.php
```

* Add this line below the salt keys section:

```php
define( 'WP_CACHE_KEY_SALT', 'prathameshgodse.com' );
```

* This key prefix avoids Redis key collisions when multiple WordPress sites share Redis.

---

### Step 6: Reload PHP-FPM

* Restart PHP-FPM to load the Redis PHP extension:

```bash
fpmr
```

* Assuming `fpmr` is an alias for:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart php8.3-fpm
```

---

## Best Practices

* Always back up configuration files before modifying.
* Confirm Redis service and logs show no errors after each step.
* Tune `maxmemory` according to server resources and expected cache size.
* Use a unique `WP_CACHE_KEY_SALT` per WordPress site sharing the Redis instance.
* Ensure PHP-FPM restart to properly load the Redis extension.
* Install and activate a WordPress Redis object cache plugin to complete integration.
