## ⚡ Setting Up Redis Server for WordPress Object Caching (PHP 8.3)

---

### 🧱 Step 1: Install Redis and PHP Extension

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install redis-server php8.3-redis
```

> 🧩 This installs the Redis server and the PHP Redis extension needed for WordPress to interact with Redis.

---

### 🧪 Step 2: Verify Redis is Running

```bash
sudo systemctl status redis-server
```

```bash
cd /var/log/
sudo cat redis/redis-server.log
```

> ✅ Make sure Redis is active and not reporting any critical errors.

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Improve Redis Memory Handling (overcommit setting)

```bash
cd /etc/sysctl.d/
sudo nano 11-redis.conf
```

Add:

```conf
vm.overcommit_memory = 1
```

> 📌 Prevents out-of-memory errors by allowing Redis to use more memory than estimated.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, recheck:

```bash
sudo systemctl status redis-server
sudo cat /var/log/redis/redis-server.log
```

---

### 🛠️ Step 4: Configure Redis Memory and Eviction Policy

```bash
cd /etc/
sudo ls redis/
sudo cp redis/redis.conf redis/redis.conf.bak
sudo nano redis/redis.conf
```

Search and edit these lines:

```conf
maxmemory 256mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

> ✅ This sets Redis to use up to 256 MB memory and remove the **least recently used keys** when full.

Restart Redis to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart redis-server
```

---

### 🔌 Step 5: Integrate Redis with WordPress

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com/public_html/
sudo nano wp-config.php
```

Add the following **below the salt keys** block:

```php
define( 'WP_CACHE_KEY_SALT', 'prathameshgodse.com' );
```

> 🔑 This salt ensures unique Redis key prefixes for your site to prevent conflicts if multiple WordPress installs share the same Redis instance.

---

### 🔁 Step 6: Reload PHP-FPM

```bash
fpmr
```

> Assuming `fpmr` is an alias for:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart php8.3-fpm
```

---

## ✅ Final Result:

* Redis is installed and tuned for WordPress caching.
* PHP is connected to Redis using the `php8.3-redis` extension.
* WordPress is ready for Redis-based object caching (plugin installation pending).
