## ⚙️ PHP-FPM Pool User Monitoring & On-Demand Configuration

---

### 🔍 Step 1: **Display Unique PHP-FPM Pool Usernames**

```bash
grep -E '^\s*user\s*=' /etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/*.conf | awk -F= '{print $2}' | xargs | tr ' ' '\n' | sort -u
```

#### ✅ What it does:

* Finds all lines starting with `user =` in PHP-FPM pool configs.
* Extracts the usernames.
* Removes duplicates and displays one username per line.

---

### 🧮 Step 2: **Calculate Average Memory Usage per Pool User**

```bash
ps -C php-fpm --user POOL_USER -o rss= | awk '{ sum += $1; count++ } END { if (count > 0) printf ("%d%s\n", sum/NR/1024,"M") }'
```

> 🔁 Replace `POOL_USER` with an actual user (e.g., `www-data` or `prathameshgodse`).

#### ✅ What it does:

* Lists RSS memory used by `php-fpm` processes for a specific user.
* Averages the memory usage and converts it to megabytes (MB).

### ⚙️ Step 3: **Configure PHP-FPM Pool for On-Demand Mode**

```bash
cd /etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d/
ls
sudo nano example.com.conf
```

Inside `example.com.conf`, configure as follows:

```ini
pm = ondemand
pm.max_children = <calculated_value>
pm.process_idle_timeout = 10s
pm.max_requests = 500
```

#### 📝 Description of Directives:

| Directive                 | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pm = ondemand`           | Only spawns child processes when needed (good for low traffic servers). |
| `pm.max_children`         | Max simultaneous PHP processes (calculated based on memory).            |
| `pm.process_idle_timeout` | Time to wait before killing an idle process.                            |
| `pm.max_requests`         | Max requests per process before it is restarted.                        |

### 🔄 Step 4: **Apply the Configuration**

```bash
sudo systemctl reload php8.3-fpm
```

> Ensures the new pool config is loaded without stopping the server.

---

### 🧪 Step 5: **Check Logs for `max_children` Warnings**

```bash
ls /var/log/
sudo grep max_children /var/log/php8.3-fpm.log
```

#### ✅ If PHP-FPM reached the limit, you'll see:

```text
WARNING: [pool www] server reached max_children setting (25), consider raising it
```

This means the pool ran out of PHP worker processes. You should **increase** `pm.max_children` if this occurs frequently and your server has enough memory.

## 📌 Pro Tip: How to Calculate `pm.max_children`

If you want a formula:

```bash
pm.max_children = Total available RAM for PHP / Average memory per php-fpm process
```

Example:

* Total RAM for PHP: 512MB
* Average process usage: 20MB

Then:

```bash
512 / 20 = 25
```

So, set:

```ini
pm.max_children = 25
```
