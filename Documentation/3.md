# SSH Key-Based Authentication & Disabling Password Login

## Purpose

To secure SSH access by replacing password-based login with key-based authentication, significantly reducing the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.

## Structured Document

### 1. Generate SSH Key Pair on the Local Machine

```bash
ls .ssh -l
```

* Lists existing keys in the local user's `~/.ssh` directory.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

* Generates a 4096-bit RSA key pair.

* When prompted:

  ```
  Enter file in which to save the key: .ssh/server-01-keys
  ```

* This will result in:

  * Private key: `~/.ssh/server-01-keys`
  * Public key: `~/.ssh/server-01-keys.pub`

---

### 2. Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/server-01-keys.pub <username>@<server_ip>
```

* Adds the public key to the remote user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
* Grants key-based access to the remote server.

---

### 3. Log Into the Server Using the Private Key

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/server-01-keys <username>@<server_ip>
```

* Initiates an SSH session using the private key for authentication.

---

### 4. Disable Password Authentication on the Server

1. Edit the SSH configuration file:

```bash
cd /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d
sudo nano 50-cloud-init.conf
```

2. Modify or add the following lines:

```ini
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
```

* `PasswordAuthentication no`: disables login via password.
* `PermitRootLogin no`: blocks direct root login, even when using a key.

---

### 5. Apply Changes and Exit

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
exit
```

* Restarts the SSH daemon to apply the changes.
* Ends the session to test new authentication settings.

---

### 6. Verify Access Behavior

#### 6.1 Attempt Password Login (Should Fail)

```bash
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no <username>@<server_ip>
```

* Expected result:

  ```
  Permission denied (publickey)
  ```
* This confirms password authentication is disabled.

#### 6.2 Attempt Key-Based Login (Should Succeed)

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/server-01-keys <username>@<server_ip>
```

* Successfully logs in using the configured SSH key pair.

---

## Best Practices

* Always store private keys securely and offline if possible.

* Use a strong passphrase when generating SSH keys for added protection.

* Rotate SSH keys periodically and remove obsolete entries from `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

* Use the `AllowUsers` directive in SSH configuration to restrict login access to specific users.

* Set proper permissions on SSH files:

  ```bash
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/server-01-keys
  chmod 644 ~/.ssh/server-01-keys.pub
  ```

* Validate access with a new user before disabling all password-based logins to prevent accidental lockout.
