## 🔑 SSH Key-Based Authentication & Disabling Password Login

This section documents how to **generate SSH keys**, **authorize them on your server**, and **disable password-based login** for enhanced security.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* Eliminate vulnerable password-based SSH login.
* Prevent brute-force attacks by requiring a cryptographic key for access.
* Configure and verify proper secure login mechanisms using SSH key pairs.

---

### 🛠️ Generating SSH Key Pair on the Local Machine

```bash
ls .ssh -l
```

* Lists current keys in your local user's `~/.ssh` directory.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

* Generates a 4096-bit RSA key pair.

When prompted:

```
Enter file in which to save the key: .ssh/server-01-keys
```

* This creates:

  * Private key: `~/.ssh/server-01-keys`
  * Public key: `~/.ssh/server-01-keys.pub`

---

### 🚀 Copying the Public Key to the Remote Server

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/server-01-keys.pub <username>@<server_ip>
```

* Installs the public key to the remote server under the specified user’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

---

### 🔐 Logging into the Server with the Private Key

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/server-01-keys <username>@<server_ip>
```

* Connect securely to the server using your private key.

---

### 🔧 Disable Password Authentication on the Server

1. Edit the SSH daemon configuration:

```bash
cd /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d
sudo nano 50-cloud-init.conf
```

2. Add or update the following lines:

```ini
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
```

* `PasswordAuthentication no`: disables login via password.
* `PermitRootLogin no`: blocks direct root login, even with a key.

---

### 🔄 Apply Changes and Exit

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
exit
```

* Restarts the SSH service to enforce the new rules.
* Logs out of the current SSH session so you can test the updated configuration.

---

### 🔍 Verifying Access Behavior

#### ❌ Force Password Login (Should Fail)

```bash
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no <username>@<server_ip>
```

* You should see: `Permission denied (publickey)` — confirming password login is disabled.

#### ✅ Use Key-Based Login (Should Succeed)

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/server-01-keys <username>@<server_ip>
```

* This confirms key-based login is now functioning and required.

---

### ✅ Best Practices

* ✅ Always back up your private key in a secure location (offline or encrypted vault).
* 🔐 Use a passphrase when creating the key for extra security.
* 👥 Limit login to specific users using the `AllowUsers` directive in SSH config if needed.
* 🔄 Rotate keys periodically and remove old ones from `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
