# Too Many Open Files: Nginx File Descriptor Limit

## Purpose

To prevent Nginx from hitting the file descriptor limit, which can result in failed connections or inability to serve content. This is crucial for high-traffic servers or misconfigured environments.

## Structured Document

### 1. Identify the Nginx Worker Process and Check Its Limits

```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```

Find the PID of the Nginx worker process (usually running as `www-data` or `nginx`).

Check the current file descriptor limits:

```bash
cat /proc/<pid>/limits
```

Replace `<pid>` with the actual process ID.

### 2. Modify Nginx Configuration to Raise File Descriptor Limit

Edit the Nginx configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Add or update the following directive near the top level (outside any block):

```nginx
worker_rlimit_nofile 45000;
```

This sets the maximum number of open files per worker process.

### 3. Reload Nginx Configuration

Test the configuration for errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

Reload Nginx to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### 4. Reverify the Limits

Find the updated worker process PID:

```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```

Check the limits again:

```bash
cat /proc/<new_pid>/limits
```

Verify that “Max open files” reflects the updated value.

### 5. Adjust if Needed

If needed, lower the value:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Modify:

```nginx
worker_rlimit_nofile 30000;
```

Apply changes:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### 6. Increase System-Wide Limits

Update the following files to persist higher limits system-wide:

#### `/etc/security/limits.conf`

Add:

```
* soft nofile 65535
* hard nofile 65535
```

#### `/etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d/override.conf`

Create the directory if it doesn’t exist:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d/
```

Create or edit the override file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d/override.conf
```

Add the following:

```
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=65535
```

Reload systemd and restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Best Practices

* Always test Nginx configuration with `nginx -t` before reloading.
* Ensure file descriptor limits are raised both at the Nginx config level and system level.
* Monitor file usage with tools like `lsof`, `ulimit`, and `/proc/<pid>/limits`.
* Match `worker_rlimit_nofile` to the expected traffic and number of worker connections.
* Document all changes for future server audits and recovery.
