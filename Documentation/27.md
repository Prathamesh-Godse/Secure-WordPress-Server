## 📂 Too Many Open Files: Nginx File Descriptor Limit

This section addresses the common problem where Nginx may hit the file descriptor limit, causing it to fail to handle new connections or serve content. This is especially relevant for high-traffic servers or misconfigured environments.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* Increase the maximum number of files (file descriptors) the Nginx worker processes can open.
* Prevent the `EMFILE: Too many open files` error.
* Ensure the server remains stable under heavy load.

---

### 🔍 Step 1: Identify the Worker Process and Check Its Limits

```bash
ps aux | grep www-data
```

* Locate the PID of the Nginx worker process (usually running as `www-data`).

```bash
cat /proc/<pid>/limits
```

* Replace `<pid>` with the PID you found. This shows the soft and hard file descriptor limits for that process.

---

### ⚙️ Step 2: Modify Nginx Config to Raise File Descriptor Limit

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Insert or modify the `worker_rlimit_nofile` directive:

```nginx
worker_rlimit_nofile 45000;
```

This line increases the number of open files Nginx workers are allowed to have.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Test and Apply Changes

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

* Tests for syntax errors in the Nginx configuration.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

* Reloads Nginx to apply the updated configuration.

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Recheck Limits After Reload

Repeat:

```bash
ps aux | grep www-data
```

Then:

```bash
cat /proc/<new_pid>/limits
```

* Confirm that the "Max open files" value reflects the updated limit.

---

### 🧪 Step 5: Tune Again if Needed

If 45000 is too high or unnecessary:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

And adjust:

```nginx
worker_rlimit_nofile 30000;
```

Then again:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### 💡 Notes

* `worker_rlimit_nofile` applies per **worker process**. If you have 4 workers, total open files = 4 × this value.
* You must also ensure system-wide file limit is raised via:

  * `/etc/security/limits.conf`
  * `/etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d/override.conf`
