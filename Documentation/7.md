## 🕰️ Setting Server Time Zone with `timedatectl`

This section documents how to configure the server's system clock using `timedatectl` to ensure that the server reflects the correct **local time zone**.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* Ensure logs and timestamps reflect your local time.
* Fix time-related issues in services like PHP, MySQL, and SSL.
* Synchronize cron jobs and automated tasks properly.

---

### 🧪 Check Current Time Settings

```bash
sudo timedatectl
```

* Displays current time zone, system clock, and NTP synchronization status.

---

### 🌐 View All Available Time Zones

```bash
sudo timedatectl list-timezones
```

* Lists all time zones supported by the system.

To filter by region (e.g., Asia):

```bash
sudo timedatectl list-timezones | grep Asia
```

* Useful when you want to locate a specific local time zone such as `Asia/Kolkata`.

---

### 🛠️ Set the Time Zone

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata
```

* Replace `Asia/Kolkata` with the time zone you want to apply.

---

### 🔁 Verify Time Zone Change

```bash
sudo timedatectl
```

* Confirms the new time zone is active.

```bash
date
```

* Displays the current system date and time with the updated time zone.

---

### ✅ Best Practices

* Always set your server to your **local time** or **UTC**, based on your use case.
* For globally distributed systems or automation, UTC is often preferred.
* Use NTP (Network Time Protocol) for automatic time synchronization (enabled by default on most modern systems).
