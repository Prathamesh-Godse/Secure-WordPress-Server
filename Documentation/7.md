# Setting Server Time Zone with `timedatectl`

## Purpose

To configure and verify the correct time zone on a Linux server using `timedatectl`, ensuring consistent system time across logs, cron jobs, and other time-dependent services.

## Structured Document

### Check Current Time Settings

```bash
sudo timedatectl
```

Displays system time, time zone, and whether NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization is active. This is useful for auditing the current configuration.

---

### View All Available Time Zones

```bash
sudo timedatectl list-timezones
```

Returns a full list of valid time zones that can be set. To filter based on region:

```bash
sudo timedatectl list-timezones | grep Asia
```

This helps narrow down the selection for quicker configuration.

---

### Set the Desired Time Zone

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata
```

Replaces the current time zone with the specified one. Substitute `Asia/Kolkata` with the correct time zone string for your region or use UTC for global consistency.

---

### Verify the Configuration

```bash
sudo timedatectl
```

```bash
date
```

Ensures that both the system time zone and the displayed date/time are correctly updated. This verification step is critical to prevent misconfigured schedules and logs.

## Best Practices

* Set the time zone according to the server’s physical or operational region.
* Use **UTC** for systems in distributed environments or running globally to avoid issues with daylight saving and regional time differences.
* Keep **NTP synchronization enabled** for accurate and reliable timekeeping.
* Reboot is not required after setting the time zone with `timedatectl`, but it’s recommended to verify that services correctly recognize the updated setting.
