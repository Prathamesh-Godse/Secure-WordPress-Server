# 🕰️ Setting Server Time Zone with `timedatectl`

### Purpose

Configure the system clock to reflect the correct time zone, ensuring consistent timestamps across logs, services, and scheduled tasks.

---

## 🔎 Check Current Time Settings

```bash
sudo timedatectl
```

Displays the current time zone, system clock status, and NTP sync status.

---

## 🌐 View All Available Time Zones

```bash
sudo timedatectl list-timezones
```

Lists all supported time zones.

To filter by region:

```bash
sudo timedatectl list-timezones | grep Asia
```

---

## ⚙️ Set the Desired Time Zone

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata
```

Replace `Asia/Kolkata` with your preferred time zone.

---

## ✅ Verify Configuration

```bash
sudo timedatectl
```

```bash
date
```

Check both commands to confirm the change.

## 📌 Best Practices

* Use **local time** for region-specific servers and **UTC** for distributed systems.
* NTP is typically enabled by default—ensure it stays on for clock accuracy.
