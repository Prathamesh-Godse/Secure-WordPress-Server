## üåê Harden and Optimize Network Layer

This step strengthens the server‚Äôs network stack against common attacks (like SYN floods or IP spoofing), improves performance under high traffic, and optimizes memory/buffer usage.

---

### üß≠ Purpose

* Harden the kernel‚Äôs handling of packets and connections.
* Prevent spoofed and malformed packets.
* Optimize system performance for high loads and concurrent users.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Create or Modify `sysctl` Configuration

1. Go to the sysctl configuration directory:

```bash
cd /etc/sysctl.d
```

2. Create or open your custom overrides file:

```bash
sudo nano custom_overrides.conf
```

3. Add the following optimized and hardened settings:

```ini
# SWAPPINESS AND CACHE PRESSURE
vm.swappiness = 1
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50

# IP SPOOFING PROTECTION
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

# SYN FLOOD PROTECTION
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 2048
net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 2
net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries = 5

# SOURCE ROUTED PACKETS (BLOCK THEM)
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

# INCREASE NUMBER OF USABLE PORTS
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65535

# FILE HANDLES AND CORE DUMP PROTECTION
fs.file-max = 2097152
fs.suid_dumpable = 0

# TUNE NETWORK QUEUES FOR INCOMING CONNECTIONS
net.core.somaxconn = 65535
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 262144

# MEMORY BUFFERS
net.core.optmem_max = 25165824

# TCP BUFFER SIZES
net.core.rmem_default = 31457280
net.core.rmem_max = 67108864
net.core.wmem_default = 31457280
net.core.wmem_max = 67108864
```

> ‚úÖ **Note**: Ensure there are **no typos** like `rp_filter = I` (should be `1`) and all duplicate keys like `tcp_syncookies` appear only once.

---

### üîÑ Apply Changes

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After the server reboots, SSH into it again:

```bash
ssh <your_user>@<your_server_ip>
```

To verify applied settings:

```bash
sudo sysctl -a | grep -E 'swappiness|rp_filter|syncookies|accept_source_route|file-max|somaxconn|rmem|wmem'
```

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Use one `.conf` file under `/etc/sysctl.d` instead of modifying `/etc/sysctl.conf` directly.
* Always back up `/etc/sysctl.d/custom_overrides.conf` before making major changes.
* Monitor `/var/log/syslog` or `dmesg` after reboot to ensure no kernel errors.

## More

### üîß What is `custom_overrides.conf`?

`custom_overrides.conf` is a **custom system configuration file** placed inside `/etc/sysctl.d/`. This directory contains `.conf` files used by the Linux kernel at boot time to apply **runtime kernel parameters**, like memory usage, networking, and security settings.

By placing your configurations in a dedicated file like `custom_overrides.conf`, you keep your customizations clean, modular, and separated from system defaults like `/etc/sysctl.conf`.

> These values are loaded using `sysctl` at boot time or manually via `sudo sysctl --system`.

### üìù Explanation of Each Line

---

#### üîπ **SWAPPINESS AND CACHE PRESSURE**

```ini
vm.swappiness = 1
```

- Controls how aggressively the system uses **swap** memory.
    
- Range: `0` (avoid swap) to `100` (frequent swapping).
    
- `1` means: use RAM as much as possible, avoid swap unless necessary (ideal for performance).
    

```ini
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50
```

- Controls how aggressively the kernel reclaims memory used for **inode/dentry caches** (file system metadata).
    
- Lower = keep metadata in cache longer (better performance).
    
- `50` is a balanced value ‚Äî default is `100`.
    

---

#### üîπ **IP Spoofing Protection**

```ini
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
```

- Enables **Reverse Path Filtering** to prevent IP spoofing.
    
- `rp_filter = 1` checks if the incoming packet‚Äôs source IP is reachable via the same interface it came from.
    
- Applies to **default interface** and **all interfaces**.
    

---

#### üîπ **SYN Flood Protection**

```ini
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
```

- Enables **TCP SYN cookies**, a defense against **SYN flood** attacks.
    
- Cookies validate legitimate TCP handshakes.
    

```ini
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 2048
```

- Increases the queue size for **half-open connections** (SYN received but handshake not complete).
    
- Higher value helps during high traffic or attacks.
    

```ini
net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 2
```

- Reduces number of retries for final ACK in handshake.
    
- Lower retries = drop suspicious connections faster.
    

```ini
net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries = 5
```

- Sets retries for initial SYN sent by client (default = 6).
    
- Lowering this reduces the wait time for non-responsive servers.
    

---

#### üîπ **Block Source Routed Packets**

```ini
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
```

- **Source routing** allows the sender to specify the route a packet takes (can be used to bypass firewalls).
    
- Setting to `0` blocks this ‚Äî important for **security**.
    

---

#### üîπ **Increase Number of Usable Ports**

```ini
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65535
```

- Defines the range of ephemeral ports available for outbound connections.
    
- `1024‚Äì65535` is the full recommended range ‚Äî helps when handling thousands of connections (e.g., web servers).
    

---

#### üîπ **File Handle Limits and Core Dump Protection**

```ini
fs.file-max = 2097152
```

- Maximum number of file descriptors (open files) allowed system-wide.
    
- Useful for high-performance apps like Nginx, MySQL, etc.
    

```ini
fs.suid_dumpable = 0
```

- Prevents setuid programs from writing **core dumps**, which could expose sensitive data.
    
- Value `0` = safe. (`1` = enabled, `2` = only if user matches owner)
    

---

#### üîπ **Tune Network Queues for Incoming Connections**

```ini
net.core.somaxconn = 65535
```

- Sets max length of the queue of pending TCP connections.
    
- Higher = better handling of bursts of traffic (default is often ~128).
    

```ini
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 262144
```

- Max number of packets allowed to queue when kernel receives them faster than it can process.
    
- High-performance value for traffic-heavy servers.
    

---

#### üîπ **Memory Buffers**

```ini
net.core.optmem_max = 25165824
```

- Max amount of memory for socket **option buffers**.
    
- Bigger value = better performance in high-traffic scenarios.
    

---

#### üîπ **TCP Buffer Sizes (Send/Receive)**

```ini
net.core.rmem_default = 31457280
net.core.rmem_max = 67108864
net.core.wmem_default = 31457280
net.core.wmem_max = 67108864
```

- Control default and max sizes (in bytes) of **receive (`rmem`)** and **send (`wmem`)** socket buffers.
    
- Higher values are useful for high-latency, high-throughput apps like video streaming or large file transfers.
