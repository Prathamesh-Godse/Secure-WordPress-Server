## 🧑‍💻 SSH Access Management & Configuration

### ✅ 1. SSH Into the Server as `root`

```bash
ssh root@<REMOTE_SERVER_IP>
```

---

### ✅ 2. Set or Change Root Password

```bash
passwd
```

* Prompts to enter a new password for the `root` user.

---

### ✅ 3. Add a New User

```bash
adduser <username>
```

* Creates a new user and home directory under `/home/<username>`

---

### ✅ 4. Verify User Home Directories

```bash
cd /home
ls -l
```

---

### ✅ 5. Remove an Existing User (Optional)

```bash
deluser <username> --remove-home
```

* Removes the user and their home directory.

---

### ✅ 6. Change Password for a User

```bash
passwd <username>
```

* Allows you to set or reset another user's password.

---

### ✅ 7. Change Default Command-Line Editor (e.g., for `visudo`)

```bash
update-alternatives --config editor
```

* Select `nano`, `vim`, or another installed editor.

---

### ✅ 8. Grant `sudo` Privileges

```bash
visudo
```

* Find the line:

  ```bash
  # User privilege specification
  root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
  ```
* Add below it:

  ```bash
  <username> ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
  ```

---

## 🔐 SSH Configuration

### ✅ 9. Edit Main SSH Configuration

```bash
cd /etc/ssh
nano sshd_config
```

* Search for `PermitRootLogin` and **comment it out** if it appears early in the file.
* Then add this **after** the line:

  ```bash
  Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
  PermitRootLogin yes
  ```

> This line takes effect only **after includes**, making sure overrides are correctly applied.

---

### ✅ 10. Edit Cloud-Init Config for SSH

```bash
cd /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/
nano 60-cloudimg-settings.conf
```

Change or ensure the following:

```bash
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin no
```

> This disables root login but allows password login for other users.

---

### ✅ 11. Restart SSH Daemon

```bash
cd /etc/ssh
nano sshd_config  # (Final sanity check if needed)

systemctl restart ssh
```

---

### ✅ 12. Exit SSH Session

```bash
exit
```

---

## 🛡️ Notes

* Always **test new user login** before disabling root or restarting SSH service to avoid locking yourself out.
* Consider using **key-based authentication** for stronger security.
* You can define per-user settings in `.ssh/config` for easier login.
