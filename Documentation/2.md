# SSH Access Management & Configuration

# Purpose

To securely manage user access on a remote server via SSH, configure SSH settings for better security and usability, and ensure controlled privilege delegation and authentication methods.

# Structured Document

## 1. SSH Into the Server as `root`

```bash
ssh root@<REMOTE_SERVER_IP>
```

* Connects to the remote server using the `root` user.
* Replace `<REMOTE_SERVER_IP>` with the target IP address.

---

## 2. Set or Change Root Password

```bash
passwd
```

* Prompts for a new password for the `root` account.

---

## 3. Add a New User

```bash
adduser <username>
```

* Creates a new user along with a home directory at `/home/<username>`.

---

## 4. Verify User Home Directories

```bash
cd /home
ls -l
```

* Lists all user directories under `/home` to confirm user creation.

---

## 5. Remove an Existing User (Optional)

```bash
deluser <username> --remove-home
```

* Deletes the specified user and removes their home directory.

---

## 6. Change Password for a User

```bash
passwd <username>
```

* Sets or resets the password for a non-root user.

---

## 7. Change Default Command-Line Editor (e.g., for `visudo`)

```bash
update-alternatives --config editor
```

* Allows selection of a preferred text editor such as `nano`, `vim`, etc.

---

## 8. Grant `sudo` Privileges

```bash
visudo
```

* Edit the sudoers file to allow specific users administrative privileges.

* Locate the line:

  ```bash
  root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
  ```

* Add the following line below it:

  ```bash
  <username> ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
  ```

---

## SSH Configuration

## 9. Edit Main SSH Configuration

```bash
cd /etc/ssh
nano sshd_config
```

* Locate any early instance of `PermitRootLogin` and comment it out.

* Add the configuration **after** all includes:

  ```bash
  Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
  PermitRootLogin yes
  ```

* Ensures the directive is applied after include files are loaded.

---

## 10. Edit Cloud-Init Configuration for SSH

```bash
cd /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/
nano 60-cloudimg-settings.conf
```

* Update the following settings as required:

  ```bash
  PasswordAuthentication yes
  PermitRootLogin no
  ```

* Disables root login while allowing password login for other users.

---

## 11. Restart SSH Daemon

```bash
systemctl restart ssh
```

* Restarts the SSH service to apply configuration changes.

> Optional: Perform a final check with:

```bash
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

---

## 12. Exit SSH Session

```bash
exit
```

* Safely disconnects from the remote machine.

---

# Best Practices

* Always create and verify a new user with `sudo` access **before** disabling root login.
* Use key-based authentication instead of passwords for better security.
* Avoid editing SSH configuration during active sessions without fallback access.
* Keep a backup user account with administrative access in case primary credentials fail.
* Use `visudo` for editing the sudoers file to avoid syntax errors that could lock out administrative access.
* Apply principle of least privilegeâ€”only grant `sudo` to trusted users.
* Regularly review SSH logs to detect unauthorized access attempts.
