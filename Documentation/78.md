## 🧹 Removing FastCGI Caching from NGINX Configuration

These steps will **cleanly remove** all FastCGI caching configuration from your site, includes, and main NGINX config.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Create Directory for Backup or Future Scripts (Optional)

```bash
sudo mkdir nginx_bash_scripts
```

> ✅ You can use this to store useful future bash scripts for managing NGINX.

---

### 🧽 Step 2: Remove FastCGI Caching from Site Config

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available 
sudo nano prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

🔧 Inside the file:

* **Remove** the two lines added **above** the `location ~ \.php$` block (likely `add_header`, `include`, etc.)
* **Remove** the entire **FastCGI block** inside `location ~ \.php$ {}` (directives like `fastcgi_cache`, `fastcgi_no_cache`, etc.)

---

### 🧹 Step 3: Delete the Cache Exclusion Include File

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/includes
sudo rm fastcgi_cache_excludes.conf
```

> 🗑️ This removes the file that defined rules for skipping cache for POST, cookies, and certain paths.

---

### 🔧 Step 4: Remove FastCGI Directives from Main NGINX Config

```bash
cd ..
sudo nano nginx.conf
```

Inside the file:

* **Remove the FastCGI block** between:

  * `# rate limit`
  * `# virtual host configs`

  This includes:

  * `fastcgi_cache_path`
  * `fastcgi_cache_key`
  * `fastcgi_use_stale`
  * `fastcgi_ignore_headers`

---

### 🔁 Step 5: Reload and Restart NGINX

```bash
ngt  # Likely: sudo systemctl reload nginx
ngr  # Likely: sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

> ✅ This ensures NGINX loads the updated configuration without any FastCGI caching.

---

### ✅ Final Result

* All FastCGI cache paths, zones, keys, rules, and includes are removed.
* Your site now runs with standard PHP processing without NGINX-level caching.
* You can re-enable it later by following your earlier documented setup.
