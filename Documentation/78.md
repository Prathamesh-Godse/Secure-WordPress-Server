# Removing FastCGI Caching from NGINX Configuration

## Purpose

To completely and cleanly remove all FastCGI caching configurations from the NGINX main configuration, site-specific files, and cache exclusion includes, restoring standard PHP processing without caching.

## Structured Document

### Step 1: Create Directory for Backup or Future Scripts (Optional)

Create a directory to store any future NGINX-related bash scripts or backups:

```bash
sudo mkdir nginx_bash_scripts
```

This directory can be used for organizing management scripts going forward.

### Step 2: Remove FastCGI Caching from Site Configuration

Open your siteâ€™s NGINX config file:

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available 
sudo nano prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

Within the file:

* Remove any lines **above** the `location ~ \.php$` block related to caching (e.g., `add_header X-FastCGI-Cache`, `include fastcgi_cache_excludes.conf`).
* Remove the entire FastCGI cache directive block inside the `location ~ \.php$ {}` block. This includes directives such as:

  * `fastcgi_cache`
  * `fastcgi_cache_bypass`
  * `fastcgi_no_cache`
  * `fastcgi_cache_valid`

---

### Step 3: Delete the Cache Exclusion Include File

Remove the cache exclusion rules file used to skip caching for certain requests:

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/includes
sudo rm fastcgi_cache_excludes.conf
```

---

### Step 4: Remove FastCGI Directives from Main NGINX Configuration

Edit the main NGINX configuration file:

```bash
cd /etc/nginx
sudo nano nginx.conf
```

Locate and remove the FastCGI caching block between the `# rate limit` and `# virtual host configs` comments. This block typically includes:

* `fastcgi_cache_path`
* `fastcgi_cache_key`
* `fastcgi_cache_use_stale`
* `fastcgi_ignore_headers`

---

### Step 5: Reload and Restart NGINX

Apply the configuration changes by reloading and restarting NGINX:

```bash
ngt  # Alias for sudo systemctl reload nginx
ngr  # Alias for sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

---

## Best Practices

* Always back up configuration files before modifying or deleting sections.

* Test configuration syntax before reloading:

  ```bash
  sudo nginx -t
  ```

* Confirm site functionality after removal to ensure PHP processes correctly without caching.

* Document any changes for future reference.
