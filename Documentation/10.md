# Disable IPv6 on the Server

# Purpose

To remove unused IPv6 network components, reduce potential vulnerabilities, and simplify network configuration by fully disabling IPv6 support at the kernel level.

# Structured Document

## 1. Check IPv6 Status

Run the following command to determine if IPv6 is currently enabled:

```bash
ip a | grep inet6
```

If output is shown, IPv6 is active on one or more interfaces.

---

## 2. Disable IPv6 Using GRUB

### Step 1: Edit GRUB Configuration

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

### Step 2: Modify the Kernel Parameters

Locate this line:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
```

Change it to:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="ipv6.disable=1"
```

---

## 3. Apply the Changes

Update the GRUB configuration and reboot:

```bash
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

---

## 4. Confirm IPv6 is Disabled

After the reboot, verify IPv6 is no longer active:

```bash
ip a | grep inet6
```

No output indicates IPv6 is fully disabled.

---

## 5. Additional Tips

### Firewall and Host Configuration

* Remove or update any IPv6-specific firewall rules.
* Clean `/etc/hosts` of `::1` or other IPv6 entries if unused.

---

## Best Practices

* Only disable IPv6 if you’ve confirmed it’s not required by applications or services.
* Ensure the configuration is tested in staging environments if applied to production systems.
* Keep GRUB backed up before making changes.
