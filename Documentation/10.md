## 🚫 Disable IPv6 on the Server

Disabling IPv6 can help harden the server by removing unnecessary network stack components, reducing the attack surface — especially if you're not using IPv6 services.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* Disable all IPv6 interfaces on the server.
* Prevent services from listening on IPv6 ports.
* Simplify firewall rules when IPv6 is not needed.

---

### 🔍 Check If IPv6 Is Active

```bash
ip a | grep inet6
```

* This command lists all active IPv6 addresses.
* If you see `inet6` entries, then IPv6 is enabled.

---

### ⚙️ Disable IPv6 via GRUB Bootloader

1. Open the GRUB config file:

```bash
cd /etc/default
sudo nano grub
```

2. Locate the line:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
```

3. Modify it like this:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="ipv6.disable=1"
```

* This instructs the Linux kernel to disable IPv6 during boot.

---

### 🔄 Apply Changes and Reboot

1. Update the GRUB configuration:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

2. Reboot the server:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### ✅ Confirm IPv6 is Disabled

After reboot, SSH back into the server:

```bash
ssh <your_user>@<your_server_ip>
```

Then run:

```bash
ip a | grep inet6
```

* If the command shows **no output**, IPv6 has been successfully disabled.

---

### 🛡️ Best Practices

* Only disable IPv6 if you are certain it’s not used by your ISP, DNS, web applications, or internal tools.
* Keep your `/etc/hosts` and firewall rules updated to avoid referencing IPv6.
