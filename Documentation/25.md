### ðŸ§© Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **`open_file_cache max=50000 inactive=60s;`**

   * **`max=50000`**: Specifies the maximum number of file descriptors (open files, directories, etc.) to cache.
   * **`inactive=60s`**: Cached entries that haven't been accessed for 60 seconds will be removed.
   * âž¤ **Purpose:** Reduces disk I/O by keeping file metadata (like existence and permissions) cached in memory.

2. **`open_file_cache_valid 120s;`**

   * Tells Nginx to refresh (validate) the cached entries every 120 seconds.
   * âž¤ **Effect:** Keeps cached data up to date while reducing frequent disk checks.

3. **`open_file_cache_min_uses 2;`**

   * Only cache files that are accessed **at least twice** during the inactive time period.
   * âž¤ **Benefit:** Avoids caching files that are accessed only once, saving memory for frequently used files.

4. **`open_file_cache_errors off;`**

   * Prevents Nginx from caching file access errors (like file not found).
   * âž¤ **Use case:** Ensures temporary errors donâ€™t get cached and cause persistent problems.
