# `file_handle_cache.conf`

## Purpose

Caches file metadata (such as existence, modification time, and directory listings) to reduce disk I/O and improve Nginx performance by avoiding repeated file system checks.

---

## Configuration

```nginx
##
# FILE HANDLE CACHE
## 
open_file_cache max=50000 inactive=60s;
open_file_cache_valid 120s;
open_file_cache_min_uses 2;
open_file_cache_errors off;
```

---

## Explanation

### `open_file_cache max=50000 inactive=60s;`

* **max=50000**: Specifies the maximum number of open file descriptors (files, directories, symbolic links) to cache.
* **inactive=60s**: Cached entries that remain unused for 60 seconds will be removed.
* **Purpose**: Minimizes file system lookups by storing file metadata in memory, enhancing performance under high load.

---

### `open_file_cache_valid 120s;`

* Defines the interval in seconds after which Nginx revalidates cached metadata.
* **Effect**: Ensures freshness of cached data without performing frequent disk access.

---

### `open_file_cache_min_uses 2;`

* Only cache files that are accessed at least two times within the `inactive` period.
* **Benefit**: Prevents caching of rarely accessed files, optimizing memory usage for files with repeated use.

---

### `open_file_cache_errors off;`

* Disables caching of errors encountered when accessing files.
* **Use case**: Prevents Nginx from storing temporary file access errors (e.g., file not found), allowing recovery when the file becomes available again.
