## 📂 Log File Inspection for NGINX (Per-Site)

You're inspecting **site-specific logs** to debug or monitor issues with `example.com`.

---

### 🔍 Navigate to NGINX Log Directory

```bash
cd /var/log/nginx
```

* This is where NGINX stores **all access and error logs**, globally and per-site.

---

### 📄 View Contents of the Directory

```bash
ls
```

* Lists all files in the `nginx` log directory.
* You should see:

  * `access.log` and `error.log` (default/global)
  * `access.log.example.com.log` and `error.log.example.com.log` (site-specific, if defined)

---

### 🛠️ View Current Error Log

```bash
sudo cat error.log.example.com.log
```

* Shows real-time **error messages** like:

  * Syntax/config errors
  * PHP issues
  * 404 or 403 errors
  * Permission issues

---

### 📜 View Rotated Error Log

```bash
sudo cat error.log.example.com.log.1
```

* `.log.1` is the **rotated version** of the log from previous days (by logrotate).
* Useful if the issue occurred yesterday or earlier.

---

### 🧾 View Current Access Log

```bash
sudo cat access.log.example.com.log
```

* Lists **every HTTP request** to your domain.
* Includes:

  * IP address
  * Timestamp
  * Request method & path
  * Response code (200, 404, 500, etc.)
  * User agent
* Useful for debugging user activity, bot attacks, broken links, etc.

---

## ✅ Tips

* Use `less` instead of `cat` for easier scrolling:

  ```bash
  sudo less error.log.example.com.log
  ```

* Use `tail` for live updates:

  ```bash
  sudo tail -f error.log.example.com.log
  ```
