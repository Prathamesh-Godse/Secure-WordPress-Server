# Log File Inspection for NGINX (Per-Site)

## Purpose

To inspect site-specific NGINX log files for monitoring HTTP activity, identifying errors, and diagnosing issues related to configuration, permissions, or request handling.

## Structured Document

### Navigate to NGINX Log Directory

```bash
cd /var/log/nginx
```

* Default location for all NGINX log files.
* Contains global logs as well as site-specific logs if configured.

---

### View Contents of the Log Directory

```bash
ls
```

* Lists available log files in the NGINX directory.
* Expected files:

  * `access.log`, `error.log` — Global logs.
  * `access.log.example.com.log`, `error.log.example.com.log` — Site-specific logs (if configured in virtual host).

---

### View Current Error Log (Site-Specific)

```bash
sudo cat error.log.example.com.log
```

* Displays current error log for `example.com`.
* Common errors include:

  * Configuration syntax issues
  * PHP execution errors
  * Missing files (404)
  * Access denials (403)

---

### View Rotated Error Log

```bash
sudo cat error.log.example.com.log.1
```

* Displays the previous version of the error log (rotated by `logrotate`).
* Useful for reviewing issues that occurred on prior days.

---

### View Current Access Log (Site-Specific)

```bash
sudo cat access.log.example.com.log
```

* Shows all HTTP requests made to the site.
* Fields include:

  * IP address
  * Date and time
  * HTTP method and URI
  * Response status code (e.g., 200, 404)
  * User agent string

---

## Best Practices

* Use `less` for easier navigation of large logs:

  ```bash
  sudo less error.log.example.com.log
  ```

* Use `tail -f` to monitor logs in real time:

  ```bash
  sudo tail -f error.log.example.com.log
  ```

* Periodically review `access.log` for suspicious IPs, request patterns, or bots.

* Archive and back up logs regularly for auditing purposes.

* If logs are missing, ensure that logging is enabled in your site’s NGINX configuration block:

  ```nginx
  access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log.example.com.log;
  error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log.example.com.log;
  ```

* Limit log size via log rotation policies defined in `/etc/logrotate.d/nginx`.
