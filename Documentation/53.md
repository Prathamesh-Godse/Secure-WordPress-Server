# Secure Custom Temporary Directory for PHP (Per Site)

## Purpose

To isolate temporary directories for individual sites, preventing unauthorized access and improving PHP file upload security, especially for WordPress-based deployments.

## Structured Document

### Step 1: Create a Private Temporary Directory

```bash
cd /var/www/prathameshgodse.com
sudo mkdir tmp
sudo chown prathameshgodse:prathameshgodse tmp
sudo chmod 770 tmp
```

* `tmp` will be used for PHP temporary files (e.g., uploads, sessions).
* Ownership is given to the site-specific user.
* Access is restricted to the owner and its group.

---

### Step 2: Configure PHP-FPM Pool for the Site

Modify your site's PHP-FPM pool configuration (usually found in `/etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/`):

```ini
php_admin_value[upload_tmp_dir] = /var/www/prathameshgodse.com/tmp/
php_admin_value[sys_temp_dir] = /var/www/prathameshgodse.com/tmp/
php_admin_value[open_basedir] = /var/www/prathameshgodse.com/public_html/:/var/www/prathameshgodse.com/tmp/
```

* `upload_tmp_dir`: PHP stores all uploaded files here.
* `sys_temp_dir`: PHP system temp usage is isolated.
* `open_basedir`: Restricts PHP file access to the site's public and temp directories.

---

### Step 3: Reload PHP-FPM

Use your alias or run:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload php8.3-fpm
```

This applies the new PHP-FPM pool settings without a full restart.

### Step 4: Final WordPress Hardening (via Admin Panel)

1. **Remove unused themes**, keeping only the latest default (e.g., Twenty Twenty-Four).
2. **Delete unused plugins** to minimize attack surface.
3. **Purge default pages/posts** if it's a fresh installation.
4. **Update WordPress core** from Dashboard > Updates.

## Best Practices

* Always isolate each site's temporary files to prevent cross-site contamination.
* Avoid using `/tmp` for PHP processes if multiple users or websites are hosted.
* Periodically audit permissions on the `tmp` and `public_html` folders.
* Use `open_basedir` in combination with a custom temp directory for strict access control.
* Monitor the `tmp` directory for abnormal activity or leftover files.
