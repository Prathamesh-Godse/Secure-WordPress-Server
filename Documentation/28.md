## 🧾 Bash Aliases for Nginx & PHP Management

This section introduces convenient aliases that save time and reduce typing when working with Nginx and PHP FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM).

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* Create shortcut commands for frequently used administrative tasks.
* Reduce errors and increase efficiency during server configuration and testing.
* Simplify Nginx and PHP-FPM management routines.

---

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Create Bash Aliases

1. Navigate to your home directory:

```bash
cd
```

2. Open or create the `.bash_aliases` file:

```bash
nano .bash_aliases
```

3. Add the following aliases:

```bash
alias ngt='sudo nginx -t'
alias ngr='sudo systemctl reload nginx'
alias fpmr='sudo systemctl reload php8.3-fpm'
```

* `ngt`: Tests the Nginx configuration for syntax errors.
* `ngr`: Reloads Nginx with the current configuration.
* `fpmr`: Reloads PHP 8.3 FPM service.

4. Save and exit (`Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl + X`).

---

### 🔁 Apply the Aliases Immediately

To activate the aliases in your current shell session:

```bash
source ~/.bash_aliases
```

Now, you can run:

```bash
ngt    # Tests Nginx config
ngr    # Reloads Nginx
fpmr   # Reloads PHP-FPM
```

---

### ✅ Notes

* Aliases are user-specific and only affect your shell.
* They persist across sessions but must be sourced once per login shell unless auto-loaded by `.bashrc`.
* You can list all current aliases with:

```bash
alias
```
