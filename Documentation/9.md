## 🧠 Harden Shared Memory (`/dev/shm`)

This section secures the shared memory space (`/dev/shm`) by mounting it with restricted options. Shared memory is used by various processes for inter-process communication, and leaving it unrestricted can lead to privilege escalation or code execution vulnerabilities.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* Harden `/dev/shm` to prevent executable code from being run in shared memory.
* Mitigate certain types of exploits or malicious behaviors.
* Improve overall server security posture.

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Open the `fstab` file for editing:

```bash
cd /etc
sudo nano fstab
```

#### 2. Add the following line at the bottom of the file:

```fstab
# HARDEN SHARED MEMORY
none /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
```

✅ Explanation of mount options:

| Option   | Meaning                                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `noexec` | Disallow execution of binaries in this mount                      |
| `nosuid` | Prevents `set-user-ID` and `set-group-ID` bits from taking effect |
| `nodev`  | Disallows device files in this mount                              |

> These flags help prevent attackers from using `/dev/shm` to run scripts or escalate privileges.

---

### 🔄 Reboot the Server

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### ✅ Confirm Shared Memory is Secured

After SSHing back into the server:

```bash
mount | grep shm
```

Expected output:

```
none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec)
```

> If you see `nosuid,nodev,noexec`, the hardening is successfully applied.

### 1. 🗂️ What is `fstab` for?

`/etc/fstab` is the **File System Table**.  
It tells Linux **what file systems to mount** at boot time and **how** to mount them.

Each line in `fstab` defines:

```
<device>  <mount_point>  <filesystem_type>  <options>  <dump>  <pass>
```

For example:

```fstab
/dev/sda1   /   ext4    defaults    0   1
```

It ensures:

- Your hard disks, swap, USBs, network drives, or virtual filesystems like `/dev/shm` get mounted properly.
    
- You can control security, performance, and behavior via mount options.

### 2. 🔐 Explain:

```fstab
none /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
```

This line **hardens** shared memory by mounting it securely:

|Field|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`none`|No physical device is used (it's a virtual memory mount)|
|`/dev/shm`|Mount point — the **shared memory** directory|
|`tmpfs`|File system type — uses **RAM** instead of disk|
|`defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev`|Mount options: improve security (explained below)|
|`0`|`dump`: backup utility flag — 0 means don't include in backups|
|`0`|`pass`: fsck order — 0 means do not check this at boot|

**Mount Options**:

- `noexec`: prevents executing any binary/script inside `/dev/shm`
    
- `nosuid`: disables set-user-ID or set-group-ID bits
    
- `nodev`: blocks creation/use of device files
    

These make `/dev/shm` safe from privilege escalation or script execution.

---

### 3. 🧠 What is `/dev/shm`?

`/dev/shm` stands for **shared memory**. It's:

- A **temporary in-memory filesystem** (like `/tmp` but in RAM).
    
- Used for **fast communication** between running processes (IPC).
    
- Backed by **RAM**, so it's very fast but not persistent across reboots.
    

Example users:

- Programs using POSIX shared memory.
    
- Web browsers, databases, and multimedia apps for caching.
    
- PHP or Apache processes for temporary data.
    

---

### 4. 🔍 Explain:

```bash
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,inode64)
```

This is from `mount` output. It says:

- `tmpfs`: the filesystem is RAM-based.
    
- `on /dev/shm`: it’s mounted at the `/dev/shm` directory.
    
- `type tmpfs`: confirms it uses temporary RAM-backed files.
    
- Options in `()`:
    

|Option|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`rw`|Mounted as read/write|
|`nosuid`|Blocks SUID/SGID escalation|
|`nodev`|No device files allowed|
|`noexec`|No files can be executed from this mount|
|`inode64`|Enables 64-bit inode numbers — useful for compatibility on large filesystems|

✅ These options secure the shared memory space to **prevent abuse by attackers**.

### 5. 🗂️ `/etc/fstab` Entry Format

Each line in `/etc/fstab` represents a mount configuration using this syntax:

```
<device>    <mount_point>    <filesystem_type>    <options>    <dump>    <pass>
```

Let’s go through each field in detail:

---

#### 1. 🔌 `<device>` — What to mount

This field specifies **what** is being mounted.

Examples:

- Physical device: `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/nvme0n1p3`
    
- UUID: `UUID=3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6`
    
- Label: `LABEL=MyData`
    
- Virtual: `none` (used for `tmpfs`, `proc`, `sysfs`, etc.)
    

---

#### 2. 📁 `<mount_point>` — Where to mount it

Specifies the **directory in the filesystem** where the device will be mounted.

Examples:

- `/` → root filesystem
    
- `/home` → users' directories
    
- `/mnt/usb` → external drives
    
- `/dev/shm` → shared memory (RAM)
    

---

#### 3. 🧾 `<filesystem_type>` — Type of filesystem

Tells the system what **kind of file system** the device uses.

Examples:

- `ext4` — common Linux filesystem
    
- `vfat` — for USB drives with FAT32
    
- `ntfs` — Windows partitions
    
- `swap` — swap space
    
- `tmpfs` — RAM-backed virtual filesystem
    

---

#### 4. ⚙️ `<options>` — Mount options

Specifies how the device should be mounted. You can use **comma-separated options**.

Examples:

- `defaults` → standard set: `rw`, `suid`, `dev`, `exec`, `auto`, `nouser`, `async`
    
- `noexec` → block execution of binaries
    
- `nosuid` → disable set-user-ID
    
- `nodev` → disallow device files
    
- `ro` / `rw` → read-only or read-write
    
- `uid=1000,gid=1000` → set owner for removable media
    
- `noatime` → don't update access times (speeds up disk reads)
    

---

#### 5. 🧩 `<dump>` — Backup with `dump`

Controls whether the `dump` utility will back up this partition.

- `0` = Don't back up
    
- `1` = Include in `dump` backup
    

> 🧠 Rarely used today — you can usually just put `0`.

---

#### 6. 🛠️ `<pass>` — Filesystem check order at boot (used by `fsck`)

Tells `fsck` **what order** to check filesystems on boot.

- `0` = Don’t check this filesystem
    
- `1` = Check this first (usually `/`)
    
- `2` = Check after `/` (used for other partitions)
    

> ⚠️ Never use `1` for more than one partition — it may cause boot issues.

---

### ✅ Example

```fstab
UUID=abc123...  /home  ext4  defaults,noatime  0  2
```

|Field|Value|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`<device>`|UUID=abc123...|Filesystem identifier|
|`<mount_point>`|`/home`|Where to mount|
|`<filesystem_type>`|`ext4`|Linux ext4 format|
|`<options>`|`defaults,noatime`|Mount with default options, no atime update|
|`<dump>`|`0`|Don’t back up with `dump`|
|`<pass>`|`2`|Check after `/` during boot|
