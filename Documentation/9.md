# Harden Shared Memory (`/dev/shm`)

# Purpose

To restrict execution and device usage within the shared memory directory (`/dev/shm`) by applying hardened mount options. This mitigates the risk of privilege escalation and malicious code execution in Linux environments.

# Structured Document

## 1. Overview

The `/dev/shm` directory is used for inter-process communication and temporary file storage in memory. By default, it allows execution of binaries and the creation of special files, which can be exploited. This configuration hardens that directory to improve security.

## 2. Modify `/etc/fstab`

### Step 1: Edit the file

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

### Step 2: Add the hardened mount configuration

```fstab
# HARDEN SHARED MEMORY
none /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
```

### Mount Option Descriptions

| Option   | Description                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `noexec` | Disallows execution of binaries within this filesystem   |
| `nosuid` | Prevents the use of set-user-ID or set-group-ID programs |
| `nodev`  | Disallows the creation or use of device files            |

## 3. Apply Changes

### Reboot the system

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### Verify configuration after reboot

```bash
mount | grep shm
```

Expected output should contain:

```
none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec)
```

# Best Practices

* Always secure virtual memory filesystems such as `/dev/shm` with `noexec`, `nosuid`, and `nodev`.
* Regularly audit mount options across all filesystems using `mount` or `findmnt`.
* Ensure all changes to `/etc/fstab` are followed by a reboot and verification.
* Back up `/etc/fstab` before making changes.
* Harden other temporary directories (e.g., `/tmp`) using similar principles when applicable.
