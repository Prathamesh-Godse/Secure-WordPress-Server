# WordPress Cron Optimization Using System Cron

## purpose

To improve the reliability and performance of WordPress scheduled tasks by disabling the default WP-Cron behavior and replacing it with a system-level cron job.

## structured document

### Step 1: Disable WordPress's Built-in Cron

File:

```
wp-config.php
```

Configuration added:

```php
define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
```

This disables WordPress’s internal cron mechanism, which by default runs on every page load when visitors access the site. This default behavior can become inefficient, especially on high-traffic sites or sites with low visit frequency.

### Step 2: Add a Real Cron Job

Using the `crontab -e` command, a system cron job was configured:

```cron
*/15 * * * * wget -q -O - https://prathameshgodse.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron >/dev/null 2>&1
```

This runs `wp-cron.php` every **15 minutes**, providing consistent and predictable execution of scheduled WordPress tasks such as:

* Publishing scheduled posts
* Running plugin or theme background operations
* Executing automated updates or cleanups

Details:

* `wget -q -O -`: Quietly fetches the URL and outputs to standard output.
* `>/dev/null 2>&1`: Redirects all output and errors to null to keep cron logs clean.

### Step 3: Verify the Cron

Command used:

```bash
crontab -l
```

This confirms that the cron job was correctly added to the system’s crontab for the current user.

### Summary of Benefits

* Eliminates performance hits caused by `wp-cron.php` being invoked on every page load.
* Ensures scheduled tasks execute even on low-traffic sites.
* Provides greater control over task timing and reliability.

## best practices

* Always **disable WP-Cron** in `wp-config.php` before setting up a system cron to avoid duplicate task execution.
* Schedule cron frequency based on site activity; common intervals include every 5, 10, or 15 minutes.
* Use HTTPS when calling the cron URL to ensure secure communication.
* Avoid exposing the cron job in public if not needed; use firewall or access control if necessary.
* Regularly monitor cron task execution logs using plugin logs, system logs, or manual logging to detect failures or timeouts.
* Use `curl` or `wget` as preferred tools; ensure they are installed and available in your server environment.
