### ✅ WordPress Cron Optimization Using System Cron

You've just optimized how WordPress handles scheduled tasks (called "cron jobs") by **disabling the built-in WP-Cron** and replacing it with a reliable system-level cron job.

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 📄 1. **Disable WordPress's Built-in Cron**

In your `wp-config.php`, you've added:

```php
/** DISABLE WORDPRESS CRONS */
define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
```

✅ This prevents WordPress from triggering `wp-cron.php` every time a visitor hits the site, which can be inefficient and unpredictable.

---

#### ⏱️ 2. **Add a Real Cron Job**

Using:

```bash
crontab -e
```

You added:

```cron
*/15 * * * * wget -q -O - https://prathameshgodse.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron >/dev/null 2>&1
```

✅ This runs the WP cron script every **15 minutes**, ensuring:

* Reliable execution of scheduled tasks
* Improved performance by avoiding triggering cron on user visits

The `wget` command:

* Silently calls `wp-cron.php`
* Outputs nothing (`-q -O -`)
* Redirects output to null (`>/dev/null 2>&1`)

---

#### 🔍 3. **Verify the Cron**

With:

```bash
crontab -l
```

You confirmed the cron entry is set correctly.

### 💡 Why This Is a Good Practice

* 🚀 Better performance: Disabling WP-Cron avoids running scheduled tasks on user visits.
* 🕒 More reliable: System crons are consistent, even if your site gets low traffic.
* 🔐 More secure: Avoids exposing WP-Cron to abuse if done over HTTPS.

✅ You’ve now made WordPress faster and more reliable in handling background tasks. Let me know if you’d like to run it at a different interval or want to monitor its performance.
