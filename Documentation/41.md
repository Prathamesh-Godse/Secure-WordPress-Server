## 🌐 Enabling the Nginx Site Configuration

You're using **Nginx's recommended practice** of enabling virtual host configs via symbolic links between:

* `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` — Where all available configs live.
* `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` — Where active (enabled) configs are linked.

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

```bash
cd /etc/nginx
ls sites-*
```

* Lists files in `sites-available` and `sites-enabled`.
* Helps confirm that your config file exists and is not already linked.

---

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/prathameshgodse.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

* Creates a **symbolic link** to "enable" the virtual host.
* Nginx only loads configs from `sites-enabled`, so linking is required to activate it.

---

```bash
ls sites-* -l
```

* Verifies that the symbolic link is created and pointing correctly.

---

```bash
ngt
```

* Runs `sudo nginx -t` (you aliased it earlier).
* This tests Nginx configuration for **syntax errors** or **bad directives**.

---

```bash
ngr
```

* Runs `sudo systemctl reload nginx`.
* Applies your new configuration **without restarting the Nginx service**.

---

### ✅ Testing the Server in Browser

You check your server IP or domain in the browser:

```bash
curl -I prathameshgodse.com
```

* Sends an HTTP HEAD request.
* You should see `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` if your config and web root are valid.
* If not, you might get:

  * `403 Forbidden` → Missing `index.php` or permissions error.
  * `404 Not Found` → `index.php` doesn't exist in the document root.

---

### 📂 Navigate to Web Root

```bash
cd /var/www/prathameshgodse.com/public_html/
```

* This is your document root (`root` path in the server block).
* Place your `index.php` or other files here to make your site load properly.
