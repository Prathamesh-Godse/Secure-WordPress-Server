# Enabling the Nginx Site Configuration

## Purpose

To activate a specific Nginx virtual host configuration by creating a symbolic link from `sites-available` to `sites-enabled`, following standard Nginx practices.

## Structured Document

### Navigate to the Nginx Configuration Directory

```bash
cd /etc/nginx
ls sites-*
```

* Lists available and enabled configuration files.
* Confirms the presence of your config file and checks if it's already linked.

---

### Create Symbolic Link for Virtual Host

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/prathameshgodse.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

* Enables the virtual host by linking the config file to `sites-enabled`.
* Nginx reads configurations only from `sites-enabled`.

---

### Verify the Symbolic Link

```bash
ls sites-* -l
```

* Ensures that the symbolic link was created successfully and is pointing to the correct file.

---

### Test Nginx Configuration

```bash
ngt
```

* Alias for `sudo nginx -t`.
* Validates the Nginx configuration syntax and reports any errors.

---

### Reload Nginx

```bash
ngr
```

* Alias for `sudo systemctl reload nginx`.
* Applies the new configuration without restarting the Nginx service.

---

### Test Server Accessibility

```bash
curl -I prathameshgodse.com
```

* Sends an HTTP HEAD request to test if the site is reachable.
* Expected response: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`.

#### Common Errors:

* `403 Forbidden`: Web root exists but lacks a valid index file or proper permissions.
* `404 Not Found`: The requested file (e.g., `index.php`) does not exist in the document root.

---

### Navigate to Web Root

```bash
cd /var/www/prathameshgodse.com/public_html/
```

* The root directory specified in the server block.
* Place site files here (e.g., `index.php`) to make the site functional.

## Best Practices

* Always test configuration changes using `nginx -t` before reloading.
* Use clear and descriptive filenames for configuration files.
* Ensure correct file permissions on web root directories and files.
* Do not create circular symbolic links.
* Use separate configuration files per domain for better maintainability.
