## 🗂️ Download and Prepare WordPress

This step gets the latest WordPress release, extracts it, and sets up the config file with security best practices.

---

### 📦 Download and Extract WordPress

```bash
cd
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar xf latest.tar.gz
```

* `wget`: Downloads the latest WordPress release as a `.tar.gz` archive.
* `tar xf`: Extracts the compressed archive to create a `wordpress/` directory.

---

### 🔧 Prepare the Configuration File

```bash
cd wordpress/
mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
```

* Renames the sample config to `wp-config.php`, which WordPress uses to connect to the database and define settings.

### 🔐 Generate Secure Authentication Keys

```bash
curl -s https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/
```

* Fetches a fresh set of random, cryptographically secure **salt keys**.
* These are used by WordPress to secure cookies and authentication.

```note
... save the salt data
```

> 💡 **Important:** Save the output securely. You will paste it into the `wp-config.php` file later to replace the placeholder salt section.
