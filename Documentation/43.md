# Download and Prepare WordPress

## Purpose

To download the latest version of WordPress, extract its contents, and prepare the configuration file by incorporating strong security practices such as custom salt keys.

## Structured Document

### Download and Extract WordPress

```bash
cd
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar xf latest.tar.gz
```

* `wget`: Retrieves the latest stable WordPress release.
* `tar xf`: Extracts the archive and creates a `wordpress/` directory in the current location.

---

### Prepare the Configuration File

```bash
cd wordpress/
mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
```

* Copies the sample configuration file to `wp-config.php`, which is required for WordPress to function.
* This file will be edited to include database credentials and other settings.

---

### Generate Secure Authentication Keys

```bash
curl -s https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/
```

* Generates a set of cryptographically secure salt keys for WordPress.
* These keys are used internally to enhance security around cookies and authentication tokens.

**Note:**
Save the salt output from the above command. You will replace the placeholder section inside `wp-config.php`:

```php
define('AUTH_KEY',         'put your unique phrase here');
define('SECURE_AUTH_KEY',  'put your unique phrase here');
...
```

with the generated values.

## Best Practices

* Always use the latest official release from the WordPress website to ensure you have the latest security patches.
* Never keep the default `wp-config-sample.php` as your active config; rename and customize it.
* Do not reuse old salt keys. Always fetch a fresh set for each installation.
* Keep the `wp-config.php` file outside the web root (if supported by the server) or restrict its permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
* Remove the downloaded archive (`latest.tar.gz`) after extraction to keep the environment clean.
