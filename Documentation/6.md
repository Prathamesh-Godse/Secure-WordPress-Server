## 🚫 Fail2Ban SSH Brute-Force Protection

This section documents how to install, configure, and test **Fail2Ban** to protect your server from unauthorized SSH login attempts.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* **Prevent brute-force attacks** on SSH.
* **Automatically ban IPs** that fail to authenticate repeatedly.
* **Monitor log files** for suspicious login activity.

---

### 🛠️ Install Fail2Ban from Official Release

```bash
wget -O fail2ban.deb https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/releases/download/1.1.0/fail2ban_1.1.0-1.upstream1_all.deb
```

* Downloads version `1.1.0` of Fail2Ban.

```bash
ls
sudo dpkg -i fail2ban.deb
```
This installs a `.deb` (Debian package) file manually:

- `dpkg` is the **Debian package manager**.
    
- `-i` stands for **install**.
    
- `fail2ban.deb` is the name of the local file downloaded from GitHub.
    

👉 **Use case**: When you're installing a package that isn’t from Ubuntu’s APT repositories (like a newer version of Fail2Ban).

```bash
sudo apt -f install
```

* Installs the downloaded `.deb` package and fixes any missing dependencies.

```bash
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
```

- `apt` is the **package manager**.
    
- `-f` means **fix broken dependencies**.
    

👉 This is used **after** `dpkg -i`, which may fail if the `.deb` package is missing other required packages. `apt -f install`:

- Resolves missing dependencies.
    
- Completes or fixes the failed installation.

* Verifies the service is active and running.

---

### ⚙️ Configure Fail2Ban

```bash
cd /etc/fail2ban
ls
sudo cp jail.conf jail.local
sudo nano jail.local
```

Modify the following values:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
bantime = 7d
findtime = 3h
maxretry = 3

[sshd]
enabled = true
mode = aggressive
port = ssh
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
backend = %(sshd_backend)s
```

* `bantime`: How long an IP will remain banned (7 days).
* `findtime`: Period in which maxretry is counted (3 hours).
* `maxretry`: Number of failed attempts before banning.
* `mode = aggressive`: Enables strict protection.
* `enabled = true`: Activates the SSH jail.

- `sshd` stands for **SSH Daemon** — the background service that allows SSH connections to your server.
    
- It's what listens on port `22` and manages:
    
    - Incoming login attempts.
        
    - Authentication (passwords or keys).
        
    - Sessions.
        

In **Fail2Ban**, the `sshd` jail watches logs related to the `sshd` service and bans IPs that:

- Fail to log in too many times.
    
- Are suspected of brute-force behavior.
    

The `mode` in a Fail2Ban jail determines how **strict** or **aggressive** the banning behavior is.

Here are the common modes:

1. **Normal** (default)

	- Standard behavior.
    
	- Detects multiple failed login attempts and bans the IP.
    
	- Less sensitive to abnormal but not malicious activity.
    

2. **Aggressive**

	- Much stricter and faster to ban IPs.
	    
	- Will block IPs more quickly based on **shorter patterns of suspicious behavior**.
    
	- Useful for exposed public servers (like your VPS) to **block brute-force attempts fast**.
    

3. **Paranoid**

	- Very aggressive.
    
	- Bans IPs for even **one failed login** if the IP has never previously authenticated.
    
	- High risk of **false positives**, but good for **high-security environments**.

### 🔄 Restart and Verify

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

* Applies your updated config.

---

### 📂 Monitor Logs

```bash
cd /var/log/
ls
sudo cat auth.log
sudo cat fail2ban.log
```

* `auth.log`: Logs of all SSH attempts.
* `fail2ban.log`: Shows banned/unbanned IPs.

---

### 🧪 Test Banning

1. Try **multiple wrong SSH logins** (3 failed attempts within 3h).
2. You will be **banned automatically**.
3. You can’t connect via SSH anymore from the banned IP.

---

### 🚑 Unban an IP

1. Log in via the VPS console or from a different IP.

```bash
cd /var/log
cat fail2ban.log
```

* Look for the banned IP.

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <your_banned_ip>
```
`fail2ban-client` is the **command-line tool** to interact with the Fail2Ban service.

Common uses:

|Command|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`fail2ban-client status`|Shows global status and enabled jails|
|`fail2ban-client status sshd`|Shows status of the `sshd` jail specifically (IP bans, attempts, etc.)|
|`fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <IP>`|Unbans a specific IP|
|`fail2ban-client reload`|Reloads configuration without restarting the service|
|`fail2ban-client stop` / `start`|Manages the Fail2Ban service|


```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

* Shows active bans and jail status.

---

### ✅ Best Practices

* Use aggressive mode for production/public servers.
* Always keep an alternate console access method.
* Regularly monitor `/var/log/fail2ban.log`.
