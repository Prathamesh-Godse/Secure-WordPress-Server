# Fail2Ban SSH Brute-Force Protection

## Purpose

Protect SSH access by monitoring authentication attempts and automatically banning IPs that exhibit brute-force behavior.

## Structured Document

### 1. Install Fail2Ban from Official Release

```bash
wget -O fail2ban.deb https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/releases/download/1.1.0/fail2ban_1.1.0-1.upstream1_all.deb
ls
sudo dpkg -i fail2ban.deb
sudo apt -f install
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
```

* Installs Fail2Ban manually using the `.deb` package.
* Fixes any missing dependencies.
* Verifies the service is installed and active.

---

### 2. Configure Fail2Ban

```bash
cd /etc/fail2ban
sudo cp jail.conf jail.local
sudo nano jail.local
```

Update configuration:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
bantime = 7d
findtime = 3h
maxretry = 3

[sshd]
enabled = true
mode = aggressive
port = ssh
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
backend = %(sshd_backend)s
```

* `bantime`: IP ban duration
* `findtime`: Time window to detect failed attempts
* `maxretry`: Maximum failed attempts allowed
* `mode = aggressive`: Enables stricter detection and faster banning

---

### 3. Apply Configuration

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

---

### 4. Monitor Logs

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/auth.log
sudo cat /var/log/fail2ban.log
```

* `auth.log`: Tracks SSH login attempts
* `fail2ban.log`: Logs ban/unban actions

---

### 5. Test IP Banning

* Attempt to log in with incorrect credentials multiple times (within 3 hours)
* Verify IP is banned and SSH access is denied

---

### 6. Unban a Blocked IP

From alternate access (console or different IP):

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <banned_ip>
```

Other useful commands:

| Command                       | Description              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `fail2ban-client status`      | Show overall status      |
| `fail2ban-client status sshd` | Show status for SSH jail |
| `fail2ban-client reload`      | Reload configuration     |
| `fail2ban-client start/stop`  | Manage Fail2Ban service  |

---

## Best Practices

* Use `aggressive` mode for production and internet-exposed servers
* Maintain alternate access to the server (e.g., provider console)
* Regularly monitor log files for ban patterns or misconfigurations
* Adjust `findtime` and `maxretry` as needed for stricter or more lenient policy
