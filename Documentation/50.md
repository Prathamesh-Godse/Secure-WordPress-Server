# Secure File & Directory Permissions for `example.com`

## purpose

To enforce strict access control for the WordPress site hosted at `/var/www/example.com/public_html/`, applying the principle of least privilege for file and directory permissions. This protects against unauthorized access, accidental edits, and potential exploitation by isolating permissions to the intended user and service.

## structured document

### Step 1: Set Secure Permissions

```bash
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
```

* **Directories (`770`)**: Grants full access only to the owner and group; no access to others.
* **Files (`660`)**: Allows only read and write access for owner and group; no execution or access for others.

### Step 2: Change Ownership

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com
sudo chown -R example:example public_html/
```

* Ensures that only the user `example` and its group own the site files.
* PHP-FPM (running under `www-data` or another service group added to `example`) will have the necessary access if configured properly.

### Step 3: Reapply and Verify Permissions

```bash
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
```

* Reinforces the intended permission scheme after ownership changes.

### Step 4: Confirm PHP Execution

1. Create a temporary PHP info file:

   ```bash
   cd /var/www/example.com/public_html/
   sudo nano info123.php
   ```

2. Insert the following:

   ```php
   <?php
   phpinfo();
   ?>
   ```

3. Access it in a browser:

   ```
   http://example.com/info123.php
   ```

4. Once verified, remove the file:

   ```bash
   sudo rm info123.php
   ```

## best practices

* Use `770`/`660` instead of more permissive defaults like `755`/`644` to restrict access to the owner and group only.
* Always verify ownership before applying permissions.
* Never leave `phpinfo()` pages or other diagnostic scripts exposed on production environments.
* If PHP-FPM runs under a different group (e.g., `www-data`), ensure that group is part of the `example` group or adjust ownership accordingly.
