## 🔐 Secure File & Directory Permissions for `example.com`

This section locks down the file permissions of the WordPress project at `/var/www/example.com/public_html/` to follow the **principle of least privilege**, preventing unauthorized access and execution.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Set Secure Permissions

```bash
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
```

* `770` for directories: readable, writable, and executable by owner and group only.
* `660` for files: readable and writable by owner and group only.

### 👥 Step 2: Change Ownership

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com
sudo chown -R example:example public_html/
```

Ensures both the owner and group are `example` so that only this user and the associated services (e.g., PHP-FPM via group access) can operate on files.

### ✅ Verify Permissions Again

```bash
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
```

Reapplying to confirm ownership and permissions are correct after changes.

### 🔍 Step 3: Test PHP Execution with `phpinfo()`

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com/public_html/
sudo nano info123.php
```

Paste this into the file:

```php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

Then open your browser and visit:

```
http://example.com/info123.php
```

You should see the PHP configuration page. This confirms PHP-FPM is running correctly for your isolated pool.

> 💡 **Don’t forget to delete `info123.php` afterward to avoid exposing PHP config details.**
