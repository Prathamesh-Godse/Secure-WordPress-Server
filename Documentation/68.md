## ðŸš€ What is PageSpeed Insights?

* **PSI** is a free Google tool (via [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev)) that analyzes your websiteâ€™s performance on both **mobile and desktop** ([PageSpeed Insights][1], [DebugBear][2]).
* It provides two key types of data:

  * **Lab data** (via Lighthouse) to debug performance issues in a controlled environment.
  * **Field data** (via Chrome User Experience Report) showing real-world user experiences, including metrics like FCP, LCP, CLS, INP, and TTFB ([Google for Developers][3]).
* **Ratings** are color-coded: greenâ€¯=â€¯Good, amberâ€¯=â€¯Needs Improvement, redâ€¯=â€¯Poor ([Google for Developers][3]).

## ðŸ“Š Key Web Performance Statistics

* **Average load times**:

  * Top 100 websites: **2.5â€¯s (desktop)** and **8.6â€¯s (mobile)** to first render ([Prerender][4]).
  * Typical full load: 10.3â€¯s (desktop) and 27.3â€¯s (mobile) ([Prerender][4]).
* **User behavior and conversions**:

  * 40% of desktop users leave if load time >â€¯3â€¯s; 53% on mobile ([Prerender][4]).
  * A 0.1-second mobile speed improvement can boost conversions by \~8% ([Digital Silk][5]).
  * Businesses loading in 1â€¯s may get \~30â€¯sales per 1k users versus \~10.8 sales if loaded in 5â€¯s ([Digital Silk][5]).

## âœ… Why Speed Matters

1. **User retention**: Fast sites reduce bounce rates and improve engagement.
2. **SEO impact**: While the PSI score itself doesn't directly affect rankings, core vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) measured by PSI are ranking signals ([Google for Developers][3]).
3. **Insightful diagnostics**: PSI offers actionable recommendations (e.g., reduce render-blocking resources, optimize images, decrease TTFB) rather than just a score ([KinstaÂ®][6]).
