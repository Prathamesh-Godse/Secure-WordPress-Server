# PageSpeed Insights (PSI)

## purpose

To understand and utilize **Google PageSpeed Insights (PSI)** for analyzing and improving website performance across mobile and desktop platforms, using real-world and lab data.

### What is PageSpeed Insights

PageSpeed Insights (PSI) is a free performance analysis tool provided by Google via [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev). It measures a webpage’s performance on both mobile and desktop devices using two primary data sources:

* **Lab Data**: Collected in a controlled environment using Lighthouse. Helps developers debug performance issues.
* **Field Data**: Collected from real-world Chrome users (Chrome UX Report). Reflects real user experience, tracking metrics such as:

  * **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**
  * **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**
  * **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**
  * **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)**
  * **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**

Performance is color-coded:

* **Green**: Good
* **Amber**: Needs Improvement
* **Red**: Poor

### Key Web Performance Statistics

* **Load Times**:

  * Top 100 websites: \~2.5 s on desktop, \~8.6 s on mobile for first render.
  * Full page load: \~10.3 s on desktop, \~27.3 s on mobile.

* **User Behavior and Conversion Impact**:

  * 40% of desktop users and 53% of mobile users abandon a site if load time exceeds 3 seconds.
  * Improving mobile load time by 0.1 seconds can increase conversions by \~8%.
  * Faster load times significantly improve sales; 1-second load time can generate \~30 sales per 1,000 users vs. \~10.8 sales at 5-second load time.

### Why Speed Matters

1. **User Retention**: Faster websites reduce bounce rates and improve user engagement.
2. **SEO Impact**: While PSI score itself isn’t a direct ranking factor, associated Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) are Google ranking signals.
3. **Diagnostic Insights**: PSI provides actionable suggestions, such as minimizing render-blocking resources, optimizing images, and reducing TTFB.

### Performance Summary Table

| **Aspect**            | **Mobile**          | **Desktop**       |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| First render          | ≈ 8.6 s             | ≈ 2.5 s           |
| Bounce threshold      | > 3 s → 53% leave   | > 3 s → 40% leave |
| Ideal conversion goal | < 1–2 s             | < 1–2 s           |
| Conversion change     | +8% per 0.1s faster | N/A               |

## best practices

* Prioritize Core Web Vitals in performance audits: LCP, CLS, INP.
* Use PSI alongside Lighthouse for comprehensive lab testing.
* Optimize critical rendering path: defer or eliminate render-blocking scripts.
* Compress and serve images in next-gen formats (e.g., WebP, AVIF).
* Minimize server response time (reduce TTFB) via caching and CDN strategies.
* Continuously monitor performance on both mobile and desktop to adapt to user expectations and evolving benchmarks.
