# Install MariaDB and PHP 8.3 + Extensions

Set up the database server and backend scripting environment required for running WordPress.

---

### Purpose

* Install and enable MariaDB as the database engine.
* Add a maintained PHP 8.3 repository.
* Install PHP 8.3 with essential extensions for WordPress.
* Ensure services are active and enabled at boot.

---

### Step 1: Install and Enable MariaDB

```bash
sudo apt install mariadb-server
```

Check the service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
sudo systemctl status mariadb --no-pager -l
sudo systemctl is-enabled mariadb
```

* `status`: Checks if MariaDB is running.
* `--no-pager -l`: Shows the full status output without truncation.
* `is-enabled`: Verifies that MariaDB is set to start on system boot.

---

### Step 2: Add PHP 8.3 Repository

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
```

* Adds the Ondřej Surý PPA, a reliable and widely used source for stable PHP versions.

---

### Step 3: Install PHP 8.3 and Required Extensions

```bash
sudo apt install php8.3-{fpm,gd,mbstring,mysql,xml,xmlrpc,opcache,cli,zip,soap,intl,bcmath,curl,imagick,ssh2}
```

Installed components include:

* `php8.3-fpm`: FastCGI Process Manager, required for Nginx-based PHP processing.
* `php8.3-mysql`: Enables PHP to interact with MariaDB.
* `php8.3-gd`, `imagick`: Image manipulation libraries used in themes and media handling.
* Additional modules like `mbstring`, `xml`, `soap`, `curl`, etc. for plugin and core compatibility.

---

### Step 4: Check PHP-FPM Service Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status php8.3-fpm
sudo systemctl is-enabled php8.3-fpm
```

* Verifies that the PHP-FPM service is active and set to run on boot.
