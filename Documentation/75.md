# Enabling FastCGI Caching in NGINX Site Configuration

## Purpose

To activate FastCGI caching within a specific NGINX site configuration file, enabling response caching for PHP requests. This reduces PHP-FPM load and improves page load times for repeat visitors.

## Structured Document

### Step 1: Edit the Site Configuration File

Navigate to the `sites-available` directory and open the configuration for your site:

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo nano prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

---

### Step 2: Modify the `location ~ \.php$ {}` Block

Within the PHP location block of the site configuration, add the following directives **at the end of the block but before the closing brace `}`**:

```nginx
# FASTCGI CACHING DIRECTIVES
fastcgi_cache_bypass $skip_cache;
fastcgi_no_cache $skip_cache;
fastcgi_cache NAME;
fastcgi_cache_valid 60m;
```

Replace `NAME` with the cache zone name configured in your main `nginx.conf`, for example:

```nginx
fastcgi_cache prathameshgodse;
```

### Explanation of Site-Level FastCGI Caching Directives

| Directive              | Value         | Explanation                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fastcgi_cache_bypass` | `$skip_cache` | Prevents serving from cache under certain conditions (e.g., user-specific requests). |
| `fastcgi_no_cache`     | `$skip_cache` | Prevents saving the response to cache for matched conditions.                        |
| `fastcgi_cache`        | `NAME`        | Specifies the name of the cache zone defined in the global config.                   |
| `fastcgi_cache_valid`  | `60m`         | Defines how long a cached response remains valid (e.g., 60 minutes).                 |

> `$skip_cache` is typically defined earlier using a `map` directive to control cache bypass based on headers, cookies, or request paths.

### Step 3: Reload NGINX to Apply Changes

```bash
ngt
```

*Note:* `ngt` is a custom alias or script, generally pointing to `sudo systemctl reload nginx`.

## Best Practices

* Ensure the `fastcgi_cache_path` and `keys_zone` are already configured in your main `nginx.conf`.
* Use conditional caching (`$skip_cache`) to exclude authenticated or dynamic requests from being cached.
* Monitor cache hit rates and adjust `fastcgi_cache_valid` based on your content volatility.
* Avoid hard-caching POST or sensitive user-specific content.
* Always test caching logic in a staging environment before deploying to production.
