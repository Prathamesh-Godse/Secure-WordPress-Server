## 🧩 Enabling FastCGI Caching in NGINX Site Configuration

These steps add caching directives to your NGINX **site-specific config file** to activate FastCGI caching for PHP requests.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Edit the Site Configuration File

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo nano prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

### ✏️ Step 2: Inside the `location ~ \.php$ {}` Block

Add the following **at the end** of the block (before the closing `}`):

```nginx
# FASTCGI CACHING DIRECTIVES
fastcgi_cache_bypass $skip_cache;
fastcgi_no_cache $skip_cache;
fastcgi_cache NAME;
fastcgi_cache_valid 60m;
```

> Replace `NAME` with the actual cache zone name defined in `nginx.conf`, such as `prathameshgodse`.

### 📊 Explanation Table: Site-Level FastCGI Caching Directives

| **Directive**          | **Value**     | **Explanation**                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fastcgi_cache_bypass` | `$skip_cache` | Skips cache **reading** for certain requests (e.g., based on cookies or headers).      |
| `fastcgi_no_cache`     | `$skip_cache` | Skips cache **saving** for certain requests (e.g., logged-in users).                   |
| `fastcgi_cache`        | `NAME`        | Refers to the cache zone (defined earlier using `fastcgi_cache_path` in `nginx.conf`). |
| `fastcgi_cache_valid`  | `60m`         | Sets how long a cached response is considered valid (60 minutes here).                 |

> 🔁 `$skip_cache` is usually defined earlier using `map` blocks to conditionally enable/disable caching (e.g., skip for logged-in users).

### 🔁 Step 3: Reload NGINX to Apply Changes

```bash
ngt
```

> `ngt` is your alias or script to reload NGINX. It likely runs `sudo systemctl reload nginx`.

---

✅ **Outcome:** Your website (`prathameshgodse.com`) now benefits from FastCGI caching. This reduces load on PHP by serving cached responses for repeated requests, significantly improving performance.
