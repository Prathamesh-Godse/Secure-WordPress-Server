# `/etc/nginx/ssl/ssl_all_sites.conf` – Centralized SSL Configuration

## Purpose

To provide a modular and secure SSL configuration file that can be included across multiple Nginx server blocks. This setup enforces modern cryptographic standards, disables deprecated features, and enables HTTP/3 with QUIC support—aimed at achieving an **A+ rating on SSL Labs** and ensuring forward compatibility.

## Structured Document

### Main Configuration (`/etc/nginx/ssl/ssl_all_sites.conf`)

```nginx
# CONFIGURATION RESULTS IN A+ RATING AT SSLLABS.COM
# WILL UPDATE DIRECTIVES TO MAINTAIN A+ RATING - CHECK DATE
# DATE: MAY 2025

# SSL CACHING AND PROTOCOLS
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:20m;
ssl_session_timeout 180m;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
# ssl_ciphers must be on a single line, do not split over multiple lines
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;
ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem;

# LET'S ENCRYPT REMOVED SUPPORT 7 MAY 2025 FOR SSL STAPLING
# REMOVE OR COMMENT BOTH ssl_stapling directives
#ssl_stapling on;
#ssl_stapling_verify on;

# RESOLVER SETTINGS
resolver 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1;
resolver_timeout 15s;

ssl_session_tickets off;

# HTTP STRICT TRANSPORT SECURITY
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000;" always;
# After setting up ALL of your subdomains, comment the above and uncomment below:
# add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains;" always;

# ENABLE QUIC AND HTTP/3
ssl_early_data on;
add_header Alt-Svc 'h3=":$server_port"; ma=86400';
add_header x-quic 'H3';
quic_retry on;
```

### Explanation & Breakdown

#### 1. **SSL Session Management**

* `ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:20m;`: Allocates 20MB for session caching to improve performance on repeated connections.
* `ssl_session_timeout 180m;`: Sessions are reusable for 3 hours.

#### 2. **Protocols and Cipher Suites**

* `ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;`: Only modern, secure protocols are enabled.
* `ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;`: The server's cipher preference takes priority.
* `ssl_ciphers ...`: A curated list of strong, secure ciphers using GCM and CHACHA20 for performance and security. Must be on one line.
* `ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem;`: References a custom-generated DH parameter file to enforce Perfect Forward Secrecy.

#### 3. **OCSP Stapling (Deprecated)**

* `# ssl_stapling on;` and `# ssl_stapling_verify on;`: These are commented out because Let's Encrypt discontinued support for OCSP stapling in May 2025.

#### 4. **DNS Resolver**

* `resolver 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1;`: Uses Cloudflare's DNS for fast, secure resolution.
* `resolver_timeout 15s;`: Sets a 15-second timeout for DNS resolution attempts.

#### 5. **Session Tickets**

* `ssl_session_tickets off;`: Disables reuse of session tickets to mitigate potential replay attacks and improve security.

#### 6. **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**

* `add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000;" always;`: Instructs browsers to use HTTPS for the domain for one year.
* `# add_header ... includeSubDomains;`: Optional strict mode for enforcing HSTS across all subdomains. Should only be used when all subdomains are HTTPS-enabled.

#### 7. **HTTP/3 and QUIC Support**

* `ssl_early_data on;`: Enables support for 0-RTT data transfer in TLS 1.3 (use with caution).
* `add_header Alt-Svc 'h3=":$server_port"; ma=86400';`: Advertises HTTP/3 availability to clients.
* `add_header x-quic 'H3';`: Custom diagnostic header to confirm QUIC is enabled.
* `quic_retry on;`: Improves security and client verification in QUIC handshakes.

## Best Practices

* Always test configuration changes using `nginx -t` before applying them.
* Include this file in each virtual host block using:

  ```nginx
  include /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl_all_sites.conf;
  ```
* Regenerate `dhparam.pem` periodically to maintain strong cryptographic standards.
* Monitor deprecations from CA providers like Let’s Encrypt to stay compliant.
* Keep SSL ciphers updated based on current industry recommendations.
* Ensure all subdomains are HTTPS-enabled before enabling HSTS with `includeSubDomains`.
* Validate HTTP/3 support using tools like Chrome DevTools or curl with `--http3`.
