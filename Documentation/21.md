### ðŸ§© Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **`client_body_buffer_size 256k;`**
   Allocates 256KB of memory for buffering the request body (like POST data). Useful for handling larger forms without writing to disk.

2. **`client_body_in_file_only off;`**
   Keeps client body data in memory instead of writing it to a temporary file unless required â€” speeds up handling.

3. **`client_header_buffer_size 64k;`**
   Sets the buffer size for reading HTTP request headers. Large enough for requests with many custom headers.

4. **`client_max_body_size 100m;`**
   Limits the maximum size of the client request body (e.g., uploads).

   > **Note**: You can reduce this to `8m` after setting up WordPress if you donâ€™t need large uploads.

5. **`connection_pool_size 512;`**
   Controls the size of memory pool for keeping connection structures â€” improves efficiency in high-traffic setups.

6. **`directio 4m;`**
   Enables direct disk I/O (bypassing OS cache) for files larger than 4MB â€” helpful for serving large static files.

7. **`ignore_invalid_headers on;`**
   Automatically discards malformed or non-standard headers sent by the client â€” improves security and reliability.

8. **`large_client_header_buffers 8 64k;`**
   Sets up 8 buffers of 64KB each for large headers â€” useful for long cookies or large custom headers.

9. **`output_buffers 8 256k;`**
   Sets 8 buffers of 256KB each for sending responses to clients. Higher values improve performance when serving large dynamic responses.

10. **`postpone_output 1460;`**
    Delays sending response data until it accumulates at least 1460 bytes (size of a typical MTU) â€” helps optimize network efficiency.

11. **`request_pool_size 32k;`**
    Sets memory pool size for each request â€” controls how much memory is reserved per HTTP request structure.
