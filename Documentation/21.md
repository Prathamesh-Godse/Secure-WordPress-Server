# `buffers.conf`

## Purpose

To configure buffer-related parameters in the NGINX server to optimize memory usage, improve performance, and handle large client requests efficiently, especially for high-traffic or upload-heavy applications like WordPress.

### Explanation of Each Directive

* **`client_body_buffer_size 256k`**
  Allocates 256KB to buffer the client request body in memory. Helps avoid writing small request bodies to disk.

* **`client_body_in_file_only off`**
  Disables storing the client body in a temporary file unless required, reducing disk I/O overhead.

* **`client_header_buffer_size 64k`**
  Allocates 64KB for reading request headers. Helps accommodate large custom headers or cookies.

* **`client_max_body_size 100m`**
  Allows up to 100MB request body size for file uploads. This can be reduced to 8MB post-setup if large uploads are no longer needed.

* **`connection_pool_size 512`**
  Reserves memory for managing connections, supporting better scalability under high traffic.

* **`directio 4m`**
  Enables direct disk I/O for files larger than 4MB, bypassing the OS cache for large static file delivery.

* **`ignore_invalid_headers on`**
  Discards non-standard or malformed HTTP headers, enhancing security and preventing parsing issues.

* **`large_client_header_buffers 8 64k`**
  Allocates 8 buffers of 64KB each to handle requests with unusually large headers.

* **`output_buffers 8 256k`**
  Sets 8 buffers of 256KB for response output. Improves efficiency when serving large responses.

* **`postpone_output 1460`**
  Defers sending response data until it reaches 1460 bytes (standard MTU size) to reduce packet fragmentation.

* **`request_pool_size 32k`**
  Allocates 32KB memory pool per HTTP request for handling request data efficiently.

## Best Practices

* Set `client_max_body_size` high temporarily for initial setup and reduce later based on actual usage.
* Avoid excessively large buffer sizes to prevent memory waste on low-traffic servers.
* Use `directio` only when serving large static files from disk and when the OS caching is unnecessary.
* Keep `ignore_invalid_headers` enabled to prevent malformed requests from affecting the server.
* Match buffer sizes to the expected traffic profile and request patterns of your application.
* Regularly monitor NGINX logs to tune these values based on real-world traffic behavior.
