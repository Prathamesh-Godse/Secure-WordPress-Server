## 🛠️ Database & Admin Credential Setup for WordPress

This step ensures that your **WordPress installation has a dedicated database**, and that both the **database credentials** and **WordPress admin credentials** are securely randomized for better protection.

---

### 🔍 Check DNS Resolution

```bash
nslookup example.com
nslookup www.example.com
```

* Verifies if your domain and subdomain point to the server.
* Should return your server's public IP if DNS is configured properly.

---

### 📁 Confirm Nginx Configuration

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo cat example.com.conf
```

* Ensures the virtual host file for your domain is correctly written and contains the right `root` and `server_name` values.

---

### 🔐 Generate Random Database Credentials

```bash
cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 10 | head -n 2
```

* Creates 2 random 10-character alphanumeric strings.
* One is used as the **MySQL username**, the other as the **password**.

---

```note
example.com

db name              example_com
db_user              <random string generated>
db_pass              <random string generated>
```

---

### 🗃️ Create MySQL Database and User

```bash
sudo mysql
```

```sql
create database example_com;

grant all privileges on example_com.* to '<db_user>'@'localhost' identified by '<db_pass>';

flush privileges;

exit;
```

* `create database`: Prepares the database for WordPress.
* `grant all privileges`: Assigns the user full access to this database only.
* `flush privileges`: Applies changes immediately.

---

### 🔐 Generate Admin Credentials

```bash
cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 30 | head -n 2
```

* Generates two secure 30-character random strings.
* One will be used as your **WordPress admin username**, and the other as the **admin password**.

---

```note
admin username      <random string generated>
admin password      <random string generated>
```

> 💡 Save these credentials in a secure password manager or encrypted file. They won’t be recoverable if lost.
