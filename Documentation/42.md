# Database & Admin Credential Setup for WordPress

## Purpose

To securely create and configure a dedicated MySQL database and user for a WordPress installation, and to generate strong, random credentials for both the database and WordPress admin account.

## Structured Document

### Check DNS Resolution

```bash
nslookup example.com
nslookup www.example.com
```

* Confirms whether the domain and subdomain correctly resolve to your server.
* Should return the server's public IP address if DNS is set up properly.

---

### Confirm Nginx Configuration

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo cat example.com.conf
```

* Validates that the virtual host file is correctly configured.
* Ensure that `root` and `server_name` directives are accurate.

---

### Generate Random Database Credentials

```bash
cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 10 | head -n 2
```

* Generates two random 10-character alphanumeric strings.
* Use the first as the database username and the second as the password.

**Example Placeholder:**

```
example.com

db name   : example_com  
db_user   : <random string generated>  
db_pass   : <random string generated>
```

---

### Create MySQL Database and User

```bash
sudo mysql
```

```sql
create database example_com;

grant all privileges on example_com.* to '<db_user>'@'localhost' identified by '<db_pass>';

flush privileges;

exit;
```

* Creates the database `example_com`.
* Grants full privileges to the generated database user on this database only.
* Applies changes using `flush privileges`.

---

### Generate WordPress Admin Credentials

```bash
cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 30 | head -n 2
```

* Creates two random 30-character alphanumeric strings.
* First string is used as the WordPress admin username, second as the password.

**Example Placeholder:**

```
admin username : <random string generated>  
admin password : <random string generated>
```

> Store these credentials securely. If lost, they cannot be recovered without direct access to the database.

## Best Practices

* Always generate strong, random credentials for both the database and admin accounts.
* Do not reuse database usernames or passwords across installations.
* Store sensitive credentials using a secure password manager or encrypted storage.
* Limit database privileges strictly to what's required (in this case, only for the specific WordPress database).
* Regularly review database users and revoke unused accounts.
