# Obtain SSL Certificates (Let's Encrypt with Certbot)

## Purpose

To secure a website with HTTPS by obtaining and installing an SSL/TLS certificate using Let's Encrypt and Certbot. This guide focuses on webroot-based validation and optionally enhances SSL security with Diffie-Hellman parameters.

## Structured Document

### 1. Update System Packages

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

These commands ensure that all system packages are up to date, which is important before installing new software like Certbot.

---

### 2. Install Certbot and DNS Plugin (Optional)

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-dns-cloudflare
```

* Installs Certbot, the tool used to request and manage Let's Encrypt certificates.
* Includes DNS plugin for Cloudflare. This is **only required** if DNS-based validation is used.
* Since this guide uses **webroot validation**, the plugin is **not necessary**, but having it does not interfere.

---

### 3. Obtain Certificate with Webroot Validation

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --webroot \
  -w /var/www/example.com/public_html \
  -d example.com \
  -d www.example.com
```

Explanation of parameters:

* `--webroot`: Uses webroot-based challenge validation.
* `-w`: Specifies the web root directory for the domain.
* `-d`: Lists the domains to issue certificates for.

After successful issuance, certificates are stored under:

```
/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/
```

Expected output includes confirmation:

```
Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
```

---

### 4. Generate Diffie-Hellman Parameters (Recommended)

```bash
cd /etc/nginx
sudo mkdir ssl
cd ssl
sudo openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048
```

* Creates a 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman parameter file.
* Enhances the strength of SSL connections by enabling **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**.
* This process may take several minutes depending on system performance.

---

## Best Practices

* Always back up the certificate and private key files.
* Automate certificate renewal using Certbot’s systemd timer or cron job.
* Regenerate Diffie-Hellman parameters periodically (recommended every 1–2 years).
* Ensure Nginx or any other web server is configured to use the newly generated certificates.
* Test your SSL setup using trusted tools like [SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).
* Avoid exposing the `.well-known` directory except during certificate validation.
* Use strong ciphers and disable outdated protocols (like TLS 1.0/1.1) in your server configuration.
