# `brotli.conf`

### Purpose

Enables and configures Brotli compression in Nginx to reduce response size for supported MIME types, improving load times and server efficiency.

---

### Configuration

```nginx
##
## BROTLI
##
brotli on;
brotli_comp_level 6;
brotli_static on;
brotli_types application/atom+xml application/javascript application/json application/rss+xml application/vnd.ms-fontobject application/x-font-opentype application/x-font-truetype application/x-font-ttf application/x-javascript application/xhtml+xml application/xml font/eot font/opentype font/otf font/truetype image/svg+xml image/vnd.microsoft.icon image/x-icon image/x-win-bitmap text/css text/javascript text/plain text/xml;
```

---

### Explanation

#### `brotli on;`

Enables Brotli compression for compatible client requests. Brotli generally provides better compression ratios than Gzip for text-based content.

---

#### `brotli_comp_level 6;`

Sets the compression level for Brotli.
Valid range: `0` (fastest, lowest compression) to `11` (slowest, highest compression).
Level `6` offers a balanced trade-off between performance and compression efficiency in production environments.

---

#### `brotli_static on;`

Enables serving of pre-compressed `.br` files when available.
If `file.css.br` exists, Nginx will serve it directly instead of compressing `file.css` on the fly.
Reduces server CPU usage and speeds up file delivery.

---

#### `brotli_types ...;`

Defines which MIME types should be compressed using Brotli.
Common types included:

* **Text:** `text/css`, `text/plain`, `text/xml`, `text/javascript`
* **Fonts:** `font/eot`, `font/ttf`, `font/otf`, `application/x-font-truetype`
* **Scripts/Data:** `application/json`, `application/javascript`, `application/xml`
* **Images/Icons:** `image/svg+xml`, `image/x-icon`

Only files matching these types will be compressed. Others will be served uncompressed.
