### ðŸ§© Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **`brotli on;`**
   Enables **Brotli compression**, an alternative to Gzip that typically achieves better compression ratios.
   âž¤ **Benefit:** Faster page loads, smaller file sizes, especially for text-based content.

2. **`brotli_comp_level 6;`**
   Sets the Brotli compression level from **0 (fastest, least compression)** to **11 (slowest, best compression)**.
   âž¤ Level **6** is a good balance between CPU usage and file size reduction, suitable for production servers.

3. **`brotli_static on;`**
   Tells Nginx to serve pre-compressed `.br` (Brotli) files if available.
   âž¤ **Example:** If `style.css.br` exists, Nginx will serve it instead of compressing on the fly.
   âž¤ **Benefit:** Reduces CPU usage and speeds up response time.

4. **`brotli_types ...;`**
   Specifies which **MIME types** should be Brotli-compressed.
   âž¤ This list includes common text types (HTML, CSS, JS, XML), fonts, icons, and vector graphics.

   Commonly included MIME types:

   * **Text:** `text/css`, `text/plain`, `text/xml`, `text/javascript`
   * **Web fonts:** `font/otf`, `font/ttf`, `application/x-font-truetype`, etc.
   * **Scripts & data:** `application/json`, `application/javascript`, `application/xml`
   * **Icons & vector images:** `image/svg+xml`, `image/x-icon`
