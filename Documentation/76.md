# Configuring Cache Exclusions in NGINX

## Purpose

To define conditional rules for bypassing FastCGI caching in NGINX. These rules ensure that specific requests—such as POST submissions, admin pages, and requests from logged-in users—are always served dynamically.

## Structured Document

### Step 1: Create the Cache Exclusion Rules File

Navigate to the includes directory and create the cache exclusion configuration:

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/includes/
sudo nano fastcgi_cache_excludes.conf
```

---

### Step 2: Define Cache Bypass Conditions

Paste the following into the file:

```nginx
# NGINX SKIP CACHE INCLUDE FILE

# Default: cache is enabled
set $skip_cache 0;

# POST requests and URLs with query strings should not be cached
if ($request_method = POST) {
    set $skip_cache 1;
}
if ($query_string != "") {
    set $skip_cache 1;
}   

# Don't cache specific URIs (admin, feeds, sitemaps, dynamic pages)
if ($request_uri ~* "/wp-admin/|/xmlrpc.php|wp-.*.php|/feed/|index.php|sitemap(_index)?.xml") {
    set $skip_cache 1;
}  

# Skip cache for logged-in users or recent commenters (identified via cookies)
if ($http_cookie ~* "comment_author|wordpress_[a-f0-9]+|wp-postpass|wordpress_no_cache|wordpress_logged_in") {
    set $skip_cache 1;
}
```

This logic sets the variable `$skip_cache` to `1` for requests that should bypass the FastCGI cache.

### Explanation of Cache Bypass Rules

| Condition                | Directive                     | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default                  | `set $skip_cache 0;`          | Enables caching by default unless matched by an exclusion rule.            |
| POST Requests            | `if ($request_method = POST)` | POST requests generally change server state and must not be cached.        |
| Query String Present     | `if ($query_string != "")`    | Dynamic queries (e.g., search/filter) require fresh results.               |
| Admin and System URIs    | `if ($request_uri ~* "...")`  | Prevent caching for backend/admin paths, feeds, sitemaps, and index.php.   |
| Specific Cookies Present | `if ($http_cookie ~* "...")`  | Avoid caching when logged-in or commenting users are detected via cookies. |

### How to Use This File

Include this configuration file inside the relevant `server` block of your NGINX site configuration:

```nginx
include includes/fastcgi_cache_excludes.conf;
```

**Important:** Include this file **before** any use of `$skip_cache`, such as in `fastcgi_cache_bypass` or `fastcgi_no_cache`.

---

## Best Practices

* Maintain consistent exclusion logic across all site configurations to avoid unpredictable caching behavior.
* Avoid using `if` inside `location` blocks when possible; in this case, these are safe in the `server` context.
* Periodically review cookie names or URI patterns based on changes to the CMS or application.
* Keep all cache exclusion logic centralized in an include file for easier maintenance and reusability.
