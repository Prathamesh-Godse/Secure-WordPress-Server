## ⚙️ Configuring Cache Exclusions in NGINX

This file defines logic to **skip caching** for specific request types, paths, and users (like logged-in users or commenters). It's typically included in your site config to work with FastCGI caching.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Create the Cache Exclusion Rules File

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/includes/
sudo nano fastcgi_cache_excludes.conf
```

### 📄 Step 2: Paste the Following Content

```nginx
# NGINX SKIP CACHE INCLUDE FILE

# Default: cache is enabled
set $skip_cache 0;

# POST requests and URLs with query strings should not be cached
if ($request_method = POST) {
    set $skip_cache 1;
}
if ($query_string != "") {
    set $skip_cache 1;
}   

# Don't cache specific URIs (admin, feeds, sitemaps, dynamic pages)
if ($request_uri ~* "/wp-admin/|/xmlrpc.php|wp-.*.php|/feed/|index.php|sitemap(_index)?.xml") {
    set $skip_cache 1;
}  

# Skip cache for logged-in users or recent commenters (identified via cookies)
if ($http_cookie ~* "comment_author|wordpress_[a-f0-9]+|wp-postpass|wordpress_no_cache|wordpress_logged_in") {
    set $skip_cache 1;
}
```

### 📊 Explanation Table

| **Condition**            | **Directive**                 | **Reason for Skipping Cache**                                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Default                  | `set $skip_cache 0;`          | Enable caching unless matched by other rules.                      |
| `POST` Request           | `if ($request_method = POST)` | Dynamic changes (form submissions) shouldn't be cached.            |
| Query String Present     | `if ($query_string != "")`    | Search or filtered pages are user-specific.                        |
| URI Matches Pattern      | `if ($request_uri ~* "...")`  | Admin pages, feeds, sitemaps, etc., should always be fresh.        |
| User Has Certain Cookies | `if ($http_cookie ~* "...")`  | Logged-in users or recent commenters should see real-time content. |

### ✅ How to Use This File

Include this file inside your NGINX server block (usually at the top):

```nginx
include includes/fastcgi_cache_excludes.conf;
```

> Make sure this is included **before** using `$skip_cache` in the `fastcgi_cache_*` directives.

---

✅ **Result:** Your NGINX server will now intelligently **bypass caching** for requests that should always receive dynamic content. This balances **performance** with **correct behavior** for users.
