### üõ°Ô∏è Nginx Rate Limiting for WordPress Security

### üîß Changes Made

#### 1. **Global Rate Limit Declaration in `nginx.conf`**

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=wp:10m rate=30r/m;
```

- **Purpose:** Creates a memory zone `wp` that limits requests by each client IP.
    
- **rate=30r/m** = max **30 requests per minute** per IP.
    
- **10m** = amount of memory allocated (10MB).
    

Add this inside the `http {}` block, preferably **just after gzip settings**.

#### 2. **Rate-Limiting Configuration in Custom Include File**

Created:

```bash
/etc/nginx/includes/rate_limiting_prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

With:

```nginx
location = /wp-login.php {
    limit_req zone=wp burst=20 nodelay;
    limit_req_status 444;
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm-prathameshgodse.sock;
    include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
}

location = /xmlrpc.php {
    limit_req zone=wp burst=20 nodelay;
    limit_req_status 444;
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm-prathameshgodse.sock;
    include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
}
```


|Directive|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`location = /wp-login.php`|Applies exactly to the login URL (not a pattern match).|
|`limit_req zone=wp burst=20 nodelay;`|Applies rate-limiting: max 30 req/min (defined earlier), allows 20 extra burst requests with no delay.|
|`limit_req_status 444;`|Returns [status code 444](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#return) if over limit. This special Nginx code **closes the connection without a response** (good for stopping bots).|
|`include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;`|Sets common FastCGI parameters needed for PHP processing.|
|`fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;`|Ensures the PHP app gets the correct `Host` header (important for multi-domain or redirection logic).|
|`fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm-prathameshgodse.sock;`|Forwards request to PHP-FPM using a Unix socket specific to your domain/user.|
|`include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;`|Applies performance-related FastCGI buffer tuning.|

Same structure and purpose as `/wp-login.php`, but this time targeting `/xmlrpc.php`, which is:

- Used for **remote publishing**, **Jetpack**, **pingbacks**, and mobile app connections.
    
- Frequently **abused in DDoS and brute-force attacks**.
    

---

#### 3. **Included in `sites-available/prathameshgodse.com.conf`**

After the main PHP block (`location ~ \.php$ {}`), you added:

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/rate_limiting_prathameshgodse.com.conf;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Final Check

To complete the configuration:

```bash
sudo nginx -t  # test configuration
sudo systemctl reload nginx  # apply changes
```

### üß† Why This Matters

|Feature|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`limit_req_zone`|Tracks IP request rates for a specific zone (here, `wp`)|
|`limit_req`|Applies the rate limit rule to selected endpoints (`wp-login`, `xmlrpc`)|
|`limit_req_status 444`|Silently drops abusive traffic (no response), good against bots|
|`nodelay`|Instantly rejects requests that exceed burst rate|

Let me know if you'd like to apply this rate limiting to other URLs (like `/wp-json/`, `/admin-ajax.php`, etc.) or if you want per-user-agent limits.
