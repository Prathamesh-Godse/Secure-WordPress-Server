# Nginx Rate Limiting for WordPress

## Purpose

To protect sensitive WordPress endpoints such as `/wp-login.php` and `/xmlrpc.php` from brute-force login attempts, automated bots, and request flooding by applying IP-based rate limiting using Nginx.

---

## Structured Document

### Main Configuration File

#### `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

```nginx
http {
    ...
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=wp:10m rate=30r/m;
    ...
}
```

This declaration sets a shared memory zone named `wp` with 10 MB of memory, which is used to store state for rate limiting based on the client IP (`$binary_remote_addr`). The request rate is limited to 30 requests per minute per IP. This line must be placed inside the `http` block of the main `nginx.conf` file.

### Rate Limiting Rules for WordPress Endpoints

#### `/etc/nginx/includes/rate_limiting_prathameshgodse.com.conf`

```nginx
location = /wp-login.php {
    limit_req zone=wp burst=20 nodelay;
    limit_req_status 444;
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm-prathameshgodse.sock;
    include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
}

location = /xmlrpc.php {
    limit_req zone=wp burst=20 nodelay;
    limit_req_status 444;
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm-prathameshgodse.sock;
    include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
}
```

**Explanation of Directives:**

* `location = /wp-login.php` and `location = /xmlrpc.php`: Targets the specific endpoints most commonly abused.
* `limit_req zone=wp burst=20 nodelay;`: Applies the defined rate limiting (`wp` zone). Allows up to 20 extra requests instantly before applying the rate limit.
* `limit_req_status 444;`: When the limit is exceeded, the server drops the connection silently without responding.
* `include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;`: Loads FastCGI parameters required for PHP processing.
* `fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;`: Ensures correct HTTP Host is passed to PHP-FPM.
* `fastcgi_pass`: Forwards the request to the configured PHP-FPM socket.
* `include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;`: Applies any custom FastCGI performance configurations.

---

### Including the Rule in Virtual Host

#### `/etc/nginx/sites-available/prathameshgodse.com.conf`

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/rate_limiting_prathameshgodse.com.conf;
```

This line includes the custom rate-limiting rules in the virtual host configuration to activate them for the domain.

### Validation and Reload

After making these changes, validate and reload Nginx:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Best Practices

* Keep the `rate` conservative enough to allow real users but low enough to block abuse. Adjust `rate=30r/m` as needed.
* The `burst` value should reflect how much traffic you can tolerate in short bursts.
* Always test changes in a staging environment before applying to production.
* Use `limit_req_status 429` instead of `444` if you want the client to be informed, but `444` is better for silently dropping bots.
* Monitor logs to tune thresholds based on actual traffic behavior.
* Ensure only endpoints susceptible to abuse are rate limited to avoid affecting regular user experience.
