## üîç Explanation of Each Directive

| Directive                          | Meaning                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fastcgi_connect_timeout 60;`      | Max time (in seconds) Nginx waits to connect to the FastCGI backend (e.g., PHP-FPM).                                                  |
| `fastcgi_send_timeout 180;`        | Max time Nginx waits to send a request to the FastCGI process.                                                                        |
| `fastcgi_read_timeout 180;`        | Max time Nginx waits to receive a response from the FastCGI process.                                                                  |
| `fastcgi_buffer_size 512k;`        | Buffer size for reading the first part of FastCGI response headers. Larger size can help reduce disk usage for large headers.         |
| `fastcgi_buffers 512 16k;`         | Number and size of additional buffers for FastCGI responses. This allows more content to be buffered in memory instead of temp files. |
| `fastcgi_busy_buffers_size 1m;`    | Max size of buffers that can be busy at the same time while sending a response to the client. Should be ‚â§ sum of `fastcgi_buffers`.   |
| `fastcgi_temp_file_write_size 4m;` | Max size of data written to temp files at once (when response can‚Äôt fit in buffers).                                                  |
| `fastcgi_max_temp_file_size 4m;`   | Max size of a temp file that stores FastCGI response. If exceeded, request fails.                                                     |
| `fastcgi_intercept_errors on;`     | Allows Nginx to show custom error pages instead of passing errors from FastCGI (like PHP).                                            |

## üß© Usage Steps

1. Save the file as `/etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf`.
2. In your site configuration (`server` block), include it inside the `location ~ \.php$` block:

   ```nginx
   include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
   ```
3. Test and reload:

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

## üß™ Validation

Use the following to confirm absolute paths of includes:

```bash
readlink -f browser_caching.conf
readlink -f fastcgi_optimize.conf
```

This ensures you're referencing the correct full file paths from `/etc/nginx/includes/`.
