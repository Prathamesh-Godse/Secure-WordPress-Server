# **Nginx FastCGI Optimization Configuration**

## **Purpose**

To optimize FastCGI performance for PHP-based applications (e.g., WordPress) by configuring buffering, timeout, and error handling directives in Nginx for better resource efficiency and response handling.

## **Structured Document**

### **File: `/etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf`**

```nginx
fastcgi_connect_timeout 60;
fastcgi_send_timeout 180;
fastcgi_read_timeout 180;
fastcgi_buffer_size 512k;
fastcgi_buffers 512 16k;
fastcgi_busy_buffers_size 1m;
fastcgi_temp_file_write_size 4m;
fastcgi_max_temp_file_size 4m;
fastcgi_intercept_errors on;
```

### **Directive Breakdown**

| Directive                          | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fastcgi_connect_timeout 60;`      | Maximum time Nginx will wait to establish a connection with the FastCGI backend (e.g., PHP-FPM).                                    |
| `fastcgi_send_timeout 180;`        | Time allowed for Nginx to send a request to the FastCGI backend.                                                                    |
| `fastcgi_read_timeout 180;`        | Time allowed for Nginx to wait for a response from the FastCGI backend.                                                             |
| `fastcgi_buffer_size 512k;`        | Size of the buffer used to read the first portion of the response from the FastCGI backend. Useful for large headers.               |
| `fastcgi_buffers 512 16k;`         | Number and size of buffers used for reading the response from FastCGI. Helps reduce disk I/O.                                       |
| `fastcgi_busy_buffers_size 1m;`    | Maximum size of buffers that can be simultaneously used for client response. Should be less than or equal to the total buffer size. |
| `fastcgi_temp_file_write_size 4m;` | Maximum size of data Nginx writes to temporary files at once when buffers are insufficient.                                         |
| `fastcgi_max_temp_file_size 4m;`   | Maximum size allowed for a single FastCGI temporary file. Requests exceeding this will be dropped.                                  |
| `fastcgi_intercept_errors on;`     | Enables Nginx to serve custom error pages instead of displaying FastCGI-generated error responses.                                  |

### **Usage Instructions**

1. Save the configuration as:

   ```bash
   /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf
   ```

2. Include it in the relevant `location ~ \.php$` block within your site’s configuration file:

   ```nginx
   include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
   ```

3. Test and reload Nginx to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### **Path Validation**

To verify absolute paths to avoid misconfigurations:

```bash
readlink -f /etc/nginx/includes/browser_caching.conf
readlink -f /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf
```

## **Best Practices**

* Ensure all `include` paths are absolute to prevent ambiguity.
* Tune buffer sizes based on your server’s RAM and typical response size.
* Use `fastcgi_intercept_errors on` in combination with custom error pages for a consistent user experience.
* Monitor `nginx` and `php-fpm` logs to adjust timeout values as needed.
* Keep configuration snippets modular to reuse across different server blocks.
