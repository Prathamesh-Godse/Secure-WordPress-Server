# Activating NinjaFirewall in Full WAF Mode (WordPress Plugin)

## Purpose

To integrate **NinjaFirewall** in **Full WAF (Web Application Firewall) Mode** with your Nginx + PHP-FPM setup, allowing request filtering before WordPress loads and improving overall site security.

## Structured Document

### Configuration Context

You installed and activated the **NinjaFirewall** plugin on your WordPress site and configured it to run in **Full WAF Mode**, which allows the firewall to intercept and analyze all HTTP requests at the PHP engine level â€” before they reach WordPress or any of its plugins/themes.

No manual `wp-config.php` modification was needed in your case because **NinjaFirewall successfully used the auto-prepend mechanism** during its wizard setup.

### Key Steps Taken

1. **Installed & activated** the NinjaFirewall plugin via WordPress admin.
2. Navigated to `NinjaFirewall > Dashboard`.
3. Selected **Full WAF Mode** during the setup.
4. Chose the server type:

   ```
   nginx + CGI/FastCGI or PHP-FPM
   ```
5. Skipped the manual edit of `wp-config.php` (optional if auto-prepend is configured correctly).

### Understanding Full WAF Mode

| Feature                    | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intercepts Early**       | NinjaFirewall runs before WordPress loads, inspecting all traffic at the PHP engine layer.        |
| **Protects Entire Stack**  | Applies rules to all incoming HTTP requests, including to core, plugins, themes, and uploads.     |
| **Mitigates Threats**      | Offers defense against common attacks: XSS, SQL injection, LFI, RFI, command injection, and more. |
| **Works with PHP-FPM**     | Compatible with your setup using `nginx` and `/run/php/php8.3-fpm-example.com.sock`.              |
| **Independent of WP Core** | Continues to function even if WordPress core is down or temporarily disabled.                     |

## Best Practices

* **Keep NinjaFirewall updated** to ensure the latest threat signatures and rules are active.
* Periodically review the **firewall logs** under the plugin's dashboard to monitor suspicious activity.
* If possible, complete the optional `wp-config.php` integration to harden the firewall's initialization.
* Combine NinjaFirewall with server-level rules (like Nginx `location` blocks) for defense-in-depth.
* Avoid whitelisting IPs or user agents unless absolutely necessary; prefer rule-based exceptions.
