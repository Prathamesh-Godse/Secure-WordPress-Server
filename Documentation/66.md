### 🔐 Activating NinjaFirewall with Full WAF Mode (WordPress Plugin)

You've taken a significant step in hardening your WordPress installation by enabling **NinjaFirewall** in **Full WAF mode**. Here's what this means:

---

### ✅ What You Did

1. **Searched for “NinjaFirewall”** in the Plugins section of WordPress.
2. **Installed and Activated** the plugin.
3. Went to **NinjaFirewall > Dashboard**.
4. Chose **Full WAF Mode**:

   * Selected **HTTP Server** as:

     ```
     nginx + CGI/FastCGI or PHP-FPM
     ```
5. **Completed Installation Wizard** (you skipped editing `wp-config.php`, which is fine as Full WAF mode still works without it if auto-prepended).

### 💡 What is Full WAF Mode?

| Feature                 | Description                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full WAF Mode**       | Inserts NinjaFirewall before WordPress is even loaded, inspecting **all HTTP requests** at the PHP engine level. |
| **nginx + PHP-FPM**     | Ensures the firewall is correctly hooked even in your optimized stack (non-Apache).                              |
| **Improved Protection** | Blocks threats like XSS, SQLi, file inclusion, etc., **before they reach WordPress core**.                       |
| **Compatible with FPM** | Works with your current setup using `/run/php/php8.3-fpm-example.com.sock`.                                      |
