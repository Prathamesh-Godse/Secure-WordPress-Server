## 🚀 Enabling FastCGI Caching in NGINX for Performance Optimization

This guide explains how to configure FastCGI caching for your NGINX server to boost performance by caching dynamic content served via PHP-FPM.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Edit the NGINX Configuration File

```bash
cd /etc/nginx
sudo nano nginx.conf
```

### ✏️ Step 2: Add the FastCGI Caching Block

Paste the following below the `# rate limiting` section:

```nginx
### FASTCGI CACHING
# fastcgi_cache_path directive - PATH & NAME must be unique for each site
# Add a new fastcgi_cache_path for each site and give a new keys_zone name
fastcgi_cache_path /var/run/prathameshgodse levels=1:2 keys_zone=prathameshgodse:100m inactive=60m;

# applied to all sites
fastcgi_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri";
fastcgi_cache_use_stale error timeout invalid_header http_500;
fastcgi_ignore_headers Cache-Control Expires Set-Cookie;
```

### 📊 Explanation Table: FastCGI Cache Directives

| **Directive**                    | **Value**                                   | **Explanation**                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fastcgi_cache_path`             | `/var/run/prathameshgodse`                  | The directory where cached FastCGI responses will be stored. Must be unique per site.                             |
| `levels=1:2`                     | —                                           | Creates subdirectories to improve file system performance for large caches.                                       |
| `keys_zone=prathameshgodse:100m` | —                                           | Names the cache zone `prathameshgodse` and allocates 100MB of shared memory for storing cache keys and metadata.  |
| `inactive=60m`                   | —                                           | Cached content that hasn't been accessed for 60 minutes will be removed.                                          |
| `fastcgi_cache_key`              | `"$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri"` | Unique key for each cached item based on the full request details.                                                |
| `fastcgi_cache_use_stale`        | `error timeout invalid_header http_500`     | Serves stale cached content if errors like timeouts or HTTP 500 occur.                                            |
| `fastcgi_ignore_headers`         | `Cache-Control Expires Set-Cookie`          | Ignores headers that would normally prevent caching. Ensures content is cached even if those headers are present. |

### 🔁 Step 3: Reload NGINX

After saving changes:

```bash
ngt
```

> `ngt` is likely an alias for `sudo systemctl reload nginx` or a custom reload script.

---

✅ **Result:** FastCGI caching is now enabled for your site, improving performance and reducing load on PHP-FPM by serving cached responses for repeat requests.
