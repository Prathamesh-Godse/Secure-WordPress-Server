# Enabling FastCGI Caching in NGINX for Performance Optimization

## Purpose

To improve web server performance and reduce PHP-FPM load by enabling FastCGI caching in NGINX. This setup allows NGINX to cache dynamic PHP responses, reducing response time for subsequent requests.

## Structured Document

### Step 1: Edit the NGINX Configuration File

Navigate to the NGINX configuration directory and open the main configuration file:

```bash
cd /etc/nginx
sudo nano nginx.conf
```

---

### Step 2: Add the FastCGI Caching Block

Insert the following configuration below the `# rate limiting` section:

```nginx
### FASTCGI CACHING
# fastcgi_cache_path directive - PATH & NAME must be unique for each site
# Add a new fastcgi_cache_path for each site and give a new keys_zone name
fastcgi_cache_path /var/run/prathameshgodse levels=1:2 keys_zone=prathameshgodse:100m inactive=60m;

# applied to all sites
fastcgi_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri";
fastcgi_cache_use_stale error timeout invalid_header http_500;
fastcgi_ignore_headers Cache-Control Expires Set-Cookie;
```

This block defines where cached responses are stored, how they are keyed, and under what conditions stale content may be served.

### Explanation of FastCGI Cache Directives

| Directive                        | Value                                       | Explanation                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fastcgi_cache_path`             | `/var/run/prathameshgodse`                  | Directory to store cached FastCGI responses; must be unique per site.           |
| `levels=1:2`                     | —                                           | Organizes cache storage into subdirectories for performance.                    |
| `keys_zone=prathameshgodse:100m` | —                                           | Allocates 100MB shared memory for metadata; `prathameshgodse` is the zone name. |
| `inactive=60m`                   | —                                           | Removes cached content not accessed within 60 minutes.                          |
| `fastcgi_cache_key`              | `"$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri"` | Defines the unique cache key for each request.                                  |
| `fastcgi_cache_use_stale`        | `error timeout invalid_header http_500`     | Serves stale content if backend errors occur.                                   |
| `fastcgi_ignore_headers`         | `Cache-Control Expires Set-Cookie`          | Prevents these headers from disabling caching.                                  |

### Step 3: Reload NGINX

Apply the updated configuration:

```bash
ngt
```

*Note:* `ngt` is assumed to be a custom alias for reloading NGINX (e.g., `sudo systemctl reload nginx`).

---

## Best Practices

* Use a unique `fastcgi_cache_path` and `keys_zone` for each site to avoid cache conflicts.
* Monitor cache hit/miss ratios via access logs or NGINX status tools.
* Pair this configuration with appropriate cache purge mechanisms for dynamic content.
* Avoid caching pages with user-specific content unless session handling is explicitly managed.
* Regularly review disk usage in the cache directory and adjust `inactive` or `max_size` values as needed.
