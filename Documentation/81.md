# Temporary Setup and Revert for WP Super Cache (Expert Mode)

## Purpose

To guide the temporary activation of WP Super Cache’s Expert Mode with NGINX integration for testing purposes, followed by reverting the NGINX configuration back to the default setup once testing is complete.

## Structured Document

### Part 1: WP Super Cache – Expert Mode Activation (WordPress)

1. **Install and Activate the Plugin**

   * Install **WP Super Cache** from the WordPress plugin repository.
   * Navigate to **Settings > WP Super Cache** in the WordPress dashboard.

2. **Enable Caching (Easy Tab)**

   * In the **Easy** tab, enable caching by toggling **Caching On**.
   * Click **Update Status** to apply changes.

3. **Verify Cron System Warning**

   * Confirm if there is a warning stating:
     *“The WP-Cron system is disabled. Caching may not work as expected.”*

4. **Test Cache Functionality**

   * Still in the Easy tab, click **Test Cache**.
   * Expected result: *“The time stamps on both pages match”* indicating cache is working properly.

5. **Configure Advanced Settings**

   * Switch to the **Advanced** tab.
   * Enable the following options:

     * **Cache Delivery Method:** Expert
     * **Don’t cache pages with GET parameters**
     * **Compress pages for faster delivery**

### Part 2: Revert NGINX Configuration After Use

Once testing is complete, revert the NGINX site configuration to its original state.

#### Step 1: Open the Site Configuration

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo nano prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

#### Step 2: Modify Configuration

* **Remove** the WP Super Cache include line:

  ```nginx
  include /etc/nginx/includes/wp_super_cache_excludes.conf;
  ```

* **Uncomment** the original `location /` block:

  ```nginx
  location / {
      try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
  }
  ```

---

### Step 3: Reload and Restart NGINX

Apply the reverted configuration:

```bash
ngt   # Reload NGINX configuration (alias for sudo systemctl reload nginx)
ngr   # Restart NGINX service (alias for sudo systemctl restart nginx)
```

---

## Best Practices

* Always back up your current NGINX and WordPress configurations before making changes.
* Test cache functionality thoroughly in a staging environment before applying to production.
* After reverting, verify that the site operates normally without cached content being served.
* Use NGINX reload (`ngt`) for minimal disruption; restart (`ngr`) only if necessary.
