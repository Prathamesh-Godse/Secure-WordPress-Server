## 🔁 Temporary Setup and Revert for WP Super Cache (Expert Mode)

This guide walks you through temporarily enabling **Expert Mode** in WP Super Cache with NGINX integration, testing it, and then reverting the NGINX config to the default `location /` block.

---

### ✅ Part 1: WP Super Cache – Expert Mode Activation (WordPress)

1. **Install and Activate Plugin**

   * Install **"WP Super Cache"** from the WordPress plugin directory.
   * Go to `Settings > WP Super Cache`.

2. **Enable Caching (Easy Tab)**

   * In the **Easy** tab:

     * Toggle **Caching On**
     * Click **Update Status**

3. **Verify Cron System Warning**

   * Check if there's an alert:
     *“The WP-Cron system is disabled. Caching may not work as expected.”*

4. **Cache Tester (Still in Easy Tab)**

   * Click **Test Cache**
   * ✅ Expected result: *“The time stamps on both pages match”*

5. **Advanced Tab**

   * Enable:

     * ✅ **Cache Delivery Method**: **Expert**
     * ✅ **Don’t cache pages with GET parameters**
     * ✅ **Compress pages so they’re served more quickly to visitors**
     * ✅ **304 Not Modified browser caching**
     * ✅ **Clear all cache files when a post or page is published**
   * Click **Update Status**

6. **Preload Tab**

   * Enable **Preload Mode**
   * Configure **Preload settings**
   * Click **Save Settings**

### 🔁 Part 2: Revert NGINX Configuration After Use

Once the testing is complete, revert your NGINX configuration back to the standard setup.

#### 🧭 Step into NGINX Site Config Directory

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo nano prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

#### ✏️ Inside the File:

* 🔴 **Remove** the WP Super Cache include line:

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/wp_super_cache_excludes.conf;
```

* 🟢 **Uncomment** the original `location /` block:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
}
```

---

### 🔁 Reload and Restart NGINX

```bash
ngt  # Reload NGINX config (likely: `sudo systemctl reload nginx`)
ngr  # Restart NGINX service (likely: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`)
```

---

### ✅ Final Result

* **WP Super Cache Expert Mode** was tested with NGINX and verified to be working.
* NGINX has been **restored** to its original configuration after testing.
* Cached content was successfully served and now safely deactivated.
