# Domain Name Setup (DNS Configuration)

# Purpose

Point a domain name (e.g., `example.com`) to your server’s IP address by properly configuring DNS records. This enables access to your WordPress or other services via a human-readable domain instead of a raw IP address.

# Structured Document

## 1. DNS Records to Add

Use your DNS provider’s dashboard (e.g., Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap) to add the following:

### A Record

| Type | Name | Content            | Proxy Status | TTL  |
| ---- | ---- | ------------------ | ------------ | ---- |
| A    | `@`  | `<your-server-ip>` | DNS Only     | Auto |

* Maps the root domain (`example.com`) to your server.

### CNAME Record

| Type  | Name | Content       | Proxy Status | TTL  |
| ----- | ---- | ------------- | ------------ | ---- |
| CNAME | www  | `example.com` | DNS Only     | Auto |

* Makes `www.example.com` an alias for `example.com`.

## 2. Field Descriptions

| Field        | Description                                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type         | Defines the DNS record type (A, CNAME, etc.)                                  |
| Name         | Subdomain or domain target (`@` = root domain)                                |
| Content      | The value the record points to (IP address or hostname)                       |
| Proxy Status | Whether to proxy traffic (Cloudflare-specific: use **DNS Only** if unmanaged) |
| TTL          | How long DNS caches the record (Auto is typically recommended)                |

## 3. Notes on Proxy Status

* Set to **DNS Only** if SSL/TLS is managed directly on the server (e.g., via Let’s Encrypt).
* If using Cloudflare proxy (`Proxied`), configure SSL to **Full (Strict)** in their dashboard to avoid certificate mismatch errors.
* DNS changes may take several minutes or up to 24 hours to propagate globally.

# Best Practices

* Always configure both root (`example.com`) and `www` subdomains.
* Use DNS Only mode when issuing SSL certificates through Let's Encrypt to avoid validation errors.
* Avoid using IP addresses directly in production URLs to maintain branding, SSL, and SEO benefits.
* Set a lower TTL temporarily when making DNS changes for quicker propagation; increase afterward to reduce unnecessary lookups.
* Regularly review DNS settings for obsolete or incorrect records that may expose old infrastructure.
