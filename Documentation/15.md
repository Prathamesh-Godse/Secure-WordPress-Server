# üåê Domain Name Setup (DNS Configuration)

This section explains how to point your domain (`example.com`) to your server by updating DNS records through your DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.).

---

### üß≠ Purpose

* Make your WordPress server accessible at `https://example.com` and `https://www.example.com`.
* Ensure both the root domain and the `www` subdomain resolve to your server.
* Avoid direct usage of the IP address in browser URLs.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Add the Following DNS Records

In your DNS management dashboard (such as Cloudflare):

#### 1. **A Record**

| Type | Name          | Content (Value)    | Proxy Status | TTL  |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ---- |
| `A`  | `example.com` | `<your-server-ip>` | DNS Only     | Auto |

> This connects the domain `example.com` to your server‚Äôs IP address.

---

#### 2. **CNAME Record**

| Type    | Name  | Content       | Proxy Status | TTL  |
| ------- | ----- | ------------- | ------------ | ---- |
| `CNAME` | `www` | `example.com` | DNS Only     | Auto |

> This ensures `www.example.com` redirects to `example.com`.

---

### ‚úÖ Notes

* Set **Proxy Status** to **DNS Only** if you're managing SSL/TLS directly on your server (e.g., with Let's Encrypt).
* If you're using **Cloudflare Proxy**, ensure SSL settings in Cloudflare are properly configured (recommended: **Full (Strict)**).
* DNS changes can take several minutes to propagate across the internet, depending on your registrar.

## üß© DNS Record Field Breakdown

### 1. **Type**

- Specifies the kind of DNS record you're creating.
    
- Common types:
    
    - **A** ‚Äî Maps a domain to an IPv4 address (e.g., `192.0.2.1`)
        
    - **AAAA** ‚Äî Maps to an IPv6 address
        
    - **CNAME** ‚Äî Alias one domain to another (e.g., `www.example.com` ‚Üí `example.com`)
        
    - **MX** ‚Äî Mail exchange records for email routing
        
    - **TXT** ‚Äî Text records (used for SPF, DKIM, site verification, etc.)
        

---

### 2. **Name**

- Defines the subdomain the record applies to.
    
- Examples:
    
    - `@` ‚Äî root domain (`example.com`)
        
    - `www` ‚Äî subdomain (`www.example.com`)
        
    - `api` ‚Äî would point to `api.example.com`
        

---

### 3. **Content**

- The **value** or **destination** the record points to.
    
    - For A records: the IP address (e.g., `95.179.129.251`)
        
    - For CNAME: another domain (e.g., `example.com`)
        
    - For MX: mail server domain (e.g., `mail.example.com`)
        
    - For TXT: arbitrary text (e.g., Google verification code)
        

---

### 4. **Proxy Status** _(Cloudflare-specific)_

- Only appears if you‚Äôre using a DNS provider that includes a reverse proxy (like Cloudflare).
    
- Options:
    
    - **DNS Only** (üîµ): Only DNS resolution, no CDN, WAF, or caching.
        
    - **Proxied** (üü†): Routes traffic through Cloudflare's CDN ‚Äî enables DDoS protection, caching, SSL, etc.
        
    
    > For Let's Encrypt SSL validation and self-managed servers, use **DNS Only**.
    

---

### 5. **TTL (Time To Live)**

- Sets how long DNS resolvers cache the record before checking again.
    
- Typical values:
    
    - **Auto**: Default, provider-defined TTL (usually between 1 to 5 minutes)
        
    - **Custom**: You can set it in seconds (e.g., `300` = 5 minutes)
        

> Lower TTLs make changes propagate faster, but increase DNS traffic. Higher TTLs reduce DNS lookups but delay changes.
