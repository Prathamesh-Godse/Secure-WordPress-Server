# Create SSL Include File for Nginx

## Purpose

To modularize SSL certificate configuration in Nginx by creating a reusable include file. This approach improves maintainability, reduces duplication across virtual host configurations, and keeps SSL-related settings centralized.

## Structured Document

### 1. Create the SSL Configuration Include File

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl_example.com.conf
```

This opens a new configuration file specifically for the domain’s SSL certificate paths.

Add the following directives:

```nginx
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/chain.pem;
```

#### Directive Breakdown:

| Directive                 | Purpose                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ssl_certificate`         | Provides the complete certificate chain (server cert + intermediates). |
| `ssl_certificate_key`     | Refers to the private key that matches the certificate.                |
| `ssl_trusted_certificate` | Helps clients verify the full trust chain; useful in strict setups.    |

### 2. Verify the Absolute File Path

```bash
readlink -f /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl_example.com.conf
```

This command returns the **fully resolved absolute path** of the file. Useful for confirming correct include paths and resolving symbolic links or debugging Nginx configurations.

## Best Practices

* Store all SSL-related include files under a dedicated directory such as `/etc/nginx/ssl/`.
* Use a consistent naming convention for include files (e.g., `ssl_<domain>.conf`).
* Always verify paths and certificate validity after renewal.
* Include the SSL file in your server block using `include /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl_example.com.conf;`.
* Reload or test Nginx configuration after changes using `nginx -t` and `systemctl reload nginx`.
* Restrict file permissions to limit access to sensitive certificate key files.
* Avoid hardcoding certificate paths in multiple server blocks—use includes for consistency.
