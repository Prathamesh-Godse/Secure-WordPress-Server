# MariaDB Configuration & Optimization

## Purpose

To fine-tune MariaDB server settings for improved performance visibility, system integration consistency, and simplified management using custom bash aliases.

## Structured Document

### 1. Edit MariaDB Server Configuration

Navigate to the configuration directory and open the server configuration file:

```bash
cd /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d
sudo nano 50-server.cnf
```

Locate and modify or append the following configuration lines:

```ini
# user          = mysql
pid-file       = /run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
basedir        = /usr
# datadir       = /var/lib/mysql
# tmpdir        = /tmp

# Performance Schema
performance_schema=ON
performance-schema-instrument='stage/%=ON'
performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-current=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-history=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-history-long=ON
```

#### Configuration Details

* `pid-file`: Defines the file where the server stores its process ID.
* `basedir`: Sets the base path of MariaDB installation.
* `performance_schema`: Enables performance monitoring.
* `performance-schema-instrument`: Enables instrumentation for all execution stages.
* `performance-schema-consumer-*`: Enables data collection for current, historical, and extended historical performance stages.

### 2. Restart MariaDB

Apply the new configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
```

### 3. Create a Bash Alias for Restarting MariaDB

To streamline service management:

1. Open the alias file:

```bash
nano ~/.bash_aliases
```

2. Add the following alias:

```bash
alias mariare='sudo systemctl restart mariadb'
```

3. Reload the shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

You can now restart MariaDB with:

```bash
mariare
```

### 4. Reboot the System

After configuration changes, reboot for full integration:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Reconnect via SSH and verify MariaDB status:

```bash
systemctl status mariadb
```

## Best Practices

* Always back up configuration files before making changes.
* Use `systemctl status` after restarting services to confirm successful operation.
* Keep performance monitoring settings enabled only if necessary in production to reduce overhead.
* Document all custom aliases and share them across team environments for consistency.
* Avoid modifying commented-out defaults unless required by system-specific conditions.
