## ⚙️ MariaDB Configuration & Optimization

This part focuses on tweaking MariaDB’s configuration for better visibility into performance, maintaining consistent system integration, and simplifying service management with bash aliases.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* Enable detailed **performance monitoring** features in MariaDB.
* Adjust default paths for runtime and system integration consistency.
* Add a convenient **bash alias** for restarting MariaDB.

### 🔧 Editing the MariaDB Server Configuration

1. Open the configuration file:

```bash
cd /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d
sudo nano 50-server.cnf
```

2. Locate and modify or add the following lines:

```ini
# user          = mysql
pid-file       = /run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
basedir        = /usr
# datadir       = /var/lib/mysql
# tmpdir        = /tmp

# Performance Schema
performance_schema=ON
performance-schema-instrument='stage/%=ON'
performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-current=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-history=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-history-long=ON
```

#### 🔍 Explanation of Each Directive:

* `pid-file`: Specifies where the MariaDB process ID should be stored.
* `basedir`: The base directory where MariaDB is installed.
* `performance_schema=ON`: Enables MariaDB's Performance Schema for monitoring and diagnostics.
* `performance-schema-instrument='stage/%=ON'`: Enables instrumentation for all stages of SQL execution.
* `performance-schema-consumer-*`: These flags activate various consumers that collect performance data (current, history, long-term history).

### 🔄 Restart MariaDB

Apply the configuration changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
```

---

### ⚡ Add a Bash Alias for Convenience

1. Open your user’s alias file:

```bash
nano ~/.bash_aliases
```

2. Add this alias:

```bash
alias mariare='sudo systemctl restart mariadb'
```

3. Reload aliases (or restart terminal):

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can use:

```bash
mariare
```

To restart MariaDB easily at any time.

---

### 🔁 Reboot the System

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, SSH into the server and verify:

```bash
systemctl status mariadb
```
