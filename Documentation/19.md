# Nginx Optimization and Modular Configuration

## Purpose

To optimize core Nginx settings for performance, stability, and scalability while enabling modular configuration through include files. This allows for easier management of advanced features like compression, timeouts, buffers, and caching.

## Structured Document

### 1. Backup the Existing Nginx Configuration

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/
sudo cp nginx.conf nginx.conf.bak
```

* Navigates to the Nginx configuration directory.
* Creates a backup of the original `nginx.conf` for safety before applying custom modifications.

### 2. Base Optimized `nginx.conf` Snippet

```nginx
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;
worker_rlimit_nofile 30000;
worker_priority -10;
timer_resolution 100ms;
pcre_jit on;

events {
	worker_connections 4096;
	accept_mutex on;
	accept_mutex_delay 200ms;
	use epoll;
}
```

#### Explanation of Key Directives

* **`user www-data;`**
  Runs Nginx worker processes as the limited-permission `www-data` user.

* **`worker_processes auto;`**
  Automatically scales to match the number of CPU cores available.

* **`pid /run/nginx.pid;`**
  Specifies the file where the master process ID is stored.

* **`error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;`**
  Path to the error log used for debugging runtime issues.

* **`include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;`**
  Loads dynamic modules (e.g., Brotli, Cache Purge) from the enabled modules directory.

* **`worker_rlimit_nofile 30000;`**
  Increases open file limit per worker to support high concurrency.

* **`worker_priority -10;`**
  Elevates Nginx process priority relative to other processes on the system.

* **`timer_resolution 100ms;`**
  Sets internal timing granularity for scheduled events and timeouts.

* **`pcre_jit on;`**
  Enables PCRE Just-In-Time compilation to accelerate regex operations.

#### Events Block

* **`events { ... }`**
  Defines how Nginx handles I/O and concurrent client connections.

* **`worker_connections 4096;`**
  Each worker can handle up to 4096 concurrent connections.

* **`accept_mutex on;`**
  Ensures serialized connection acceptance between worker processes.

* **`accept_mutex_delay 200ms;`**
  Introduces a delay before the next worker can accept connections, balancing load.

* **`use epoll;`**
  Specifies the use of the `epoll` I/O model, optimal for Linux systems under heavy load.

### 3. Create Modular Include Files

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/includes
cd /etc/nginx/includes
sudo touch basic_settings.conf buffers.conf timeouts.conf gzip.conf brotli.conf file_handle_cache.conf
```

* Organizes performance and feature tuning into dedicated configuration files.
* Prepares placeholders for future inclusion in `nginx.conf` or virtual host configurations.

#### Suggested Include Files

* `basic_settings.conf`: General configuration tweaks
* `buffers.conf`: Buffer and memory tuning
* `timeouts.conf`: Read/write/connect timeouts
* `gzip.conf`: Gzip compression settings
* `brotli.conf`: Brotli compression settings
* `file_handle_cache.conf`: File descriptor caching and open file handling

#### Include Example in `nginx.conf`

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/*.conf;
```

* This directive should be placed toward the bottom of the main `nginx.conf` to load modular settings in bulk.

## Best Practices

* Always back up the original `nginx.conf` before applying changes.
* Avoid making all performance changes in the main config; use modular includes for easier rollback and separation of concerns.
* Use `nginx -t` to test configuration changes before applying them.
* Tune `worker_rlimit_nofile` and `worker_connections` based on expected traffic load and system limits.
* Monitor error logs for warnings or load-related issues after making performance changes.
* Periodically review included config files to ensure compatibility with newer Nginx versions.
