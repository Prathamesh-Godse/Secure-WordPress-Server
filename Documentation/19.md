## ⚙️ Nginx Optimization and Modular Configuration

This section documents how to modify the main Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`) and create include files for modular tuning.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

- Back up the existing Nginx config.
    
- Tune worker behavior and system-level limits.
    
- Create placeholders for modular configuration (e.g., gzip, buffers).
    
- Improve performance and control concurrency.
    

---

### 📁 Step-by-Step Commands

#### 1. Backup the Default Config

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/
sudo cp nginx.conf nginx.conf.bak
```

- Navigates to the Nginx config directory.
    
- Creates a backup of the main config file (`nginx.conf.bak`).

### 📄 `nginx.conf` Snippet

```nginx
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;
worker_rlimit_nofile 30000;
worker_priority -10;
timer_resolution 100ms;
pcre_jit on;

events {
	worker_connections 4096;
	accept_mutex on;
	accept_mutex_delay 200ms;
	use epoll;
}
```

### 🧩 Explanation Line by Line

1. **`user www-data;`**  
    Tells Nginx to run worker processes as the `www-data` user. This user typically owns web content and has limited system permissions for security.
    
2. **`worker_processes auto;`**  
    Automatically sets the number of worker processes based on the number of available CPU cores — allows full CPU utilization.
    
3. **`pid /run/nginx.pid;`**  
    Location to store the Nginx master process PID (used by systemctl and process monitoring tools).
    
4. **`error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;`**  
    Specifies the log file for Nginx errors. Helps with debugging and troubleshooting.
    
5. **`include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;`**  
    Loads any dynamic modules configured under `/etc/nginx/modules-enabled/`, such as Brotli or Cache Purge modules.
    
6. **`worker_rlimit_nofile 30000;`**  
    Increases the maximum number of file descriptors per worker process — helpful for high connection volumes and caching.
    
7. **`worker_priority -10;`**  
    Gives Nginx worker processes a higher priority in the CPU scheduler (`-10` is higher priority than `0`).
    
8. **`timer_resolution 100ms;`**  
    Sets the interval for internal Nginx timers. Lower values improve timing accuracy for delays and timeouts.
    
9. **`pcre_jit on;`**  
    Enables Just-In-Time compilation for PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), which boosts regex processing speed.

### 📦 `events` Block

10. **`events { ... }`**  
    Contains event-related settings — determines how Nginx handles connections.
    
11. **`worker_connections 4096;`**  
    Each worker process can handle up to 4096 simultaneous connections.
    
12. **`accept_mutex on;`**  
    Ensures that only one worker process handles new incoming connections at a time. Prevents multiple workers from "fighting" over connections.
    
13. **`accept_mutex_delay 200ms;`**  
    Adds a delay before another worker takes over accepting connections — helps spread load more efficiently.
    
14. **`use epoll;`**  
    Forces Nginx to use `epoll` — a fast and scalable I/O event notification system on Linux.

### 📂 Creating Include Config Files

```bash
sudo mkdir includes
cd includes
sudo touch basic_settings.conf buffers.conf timeouts.conf gzip.conf brotli.conf file_handle_cache.conf
```

- `includes/`: A directory to store modular Nginx config files.
    
- Placeholder files for future configuration:
    
    - `basic_settings.conf`
        
    - `buffers.conf`
        
    - `timeouts.conf`
        
    - `gzip.conf`
        
    - `brotli.conf`
        
    - `file_handle_cache.conf`
        

> These files will later be included in `nginx.conf` or site configs using `include` directives.
