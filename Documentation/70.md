### ‚úÖ WordPress & PHP Memory Configuration Update

You've just taken two important steps to increase memory availability for your WordPress site:

---

### üß† Step 1: Update PHP-FPM Memory Limit

In:

```
/etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

You set:

```ini
php_admin_value[memory_limit] = 256M
```

This ensures **PHP-FPM (the backend PHP processor)** has up to 256MB memory per request. It's especially useful for:

* Large themes/plugins
* Heavy admin operations
* Image processing

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Set WordPress Memory Limit

In:

```
/var/www/prathameshgodse.com/public_html/wp-config.php
```

You added:

```php
/** MEMORY LIMIT */
define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');
```

This tells **WordPress** to use up to 256MB for frontend/backend operations ‚Äî aligning it with the PHP-FPM config.

---

### üîÅ Final Step: Restart PHP-FPM

Using `fpmr` (a shortcut/alias you've defined for `sudo systemctl restart php8.3-fpm`), you reloaded the PHP service to apply these changes.

---

‚úÖ **Result:** Your WordPress site is now equipped to handle memory-intensive tasks more smoothly.
