# WordPress & PHP Memory Configuration Update

## purpose

To allocate sufficient memory for both PHP-FPM and WordPress, ensuring optimal performance during resource-intensive operations such as plugin execution, image processing, and complex admin tasks.

## structured document

### Step 1: Update PHP-FPM Memory Limit

File:

```
/etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

Configuration added:

```ini
php_admin_value[memory_limit] = 256M
```

This directive configures **PHP-FPM** to allow up to 256MB of memory per request. This is crucial for:

* Large plugins or themes that demand more resources.
* Admin actions such as bulk imports/exports or large form submissions.
* Image resizing and media processing tasks.

### Step 2: Set WordPress Memory Limit

File:

```
/var/www/prathameshgodse.com/public_html/wp-config.php
```

Configuration added:

```php
define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');
```

This constant informs **WordPress** to allocate up to 256MB of memory for operations across the frontend and backend. Aligning this with PHP-FPM prevents unnecessary memory limit conflicts and improves overall stability.

### Step 3: Restart PHP-FPM

To apply changes, the PHP service was restarted using the alias `fpmr`, which maps to:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart php8.3-fpm
```

This reloads the PHP-FPM service with the updated memory settings.

### Result

The memory configuration update enables the WordPress site to better handle:

* High-memory processes
* Media-heavy workflows
* Demanding third-party plugins or builders

## best practices

* Always ensure **PHP-FPM and WordPress memory limits are aligned** to avoid resource conflicts.
* Restart the PHP-FPM service after updating pool configuration files.
* Monitor memory usage using tools like `htop`, `top`, or PHP error logs to validate the impact of changes.
* Avoid setting unnecessarily high limits unless justified by workload; this can lead to memory overuse and affect server stability.
* Document all custom aliases (like `fpmr`) clearly in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` to maintain transparency across environments.
