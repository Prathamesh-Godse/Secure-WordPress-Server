## üîê PHP Hardening with Custom `server_override.ini`

This section shows how to override PHP‚Äôs default configuration to **reduce security risks** and disable certain insecure features in PHP 8.3 with FPM (FastCGI Process Manager).

---

### üß≠ Purpose

* **Harden PHP** against common attack vectors.
* Prevent unauthorized access to internal paths and URLs.
* Hide PHP version information from HTTP headers.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Steps

#### 1. Navigate to the PHP FPM configuration directory

```bash
cd /etc/php/8.3/fpm/conf.d
```

* This directory holds `.ini` configuration files loaded by PHP FPM.
* Files here override default settings defined in `php.ini`.

---

#### 2. Create the `server_override.ini` file

```bash
sudo nano server_override.ini
```

Then add the following:

```ini
# HARDEN PHP
allow_url_fopen = Off
cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0
expose_php = Off
```

##### Explanation of each directive:

| Directive          | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allow_url_fopen`  | Disables accessing files via URL (e.g., `http://`) with file functions. Prevents remote file inclusion.                         |
| `cgi.fix_pathinfo` | Setting this to `0` prevents PHP from trying to guess the script name in malformed URLs. Helps avoid unwanted script execution. |
| `expose_php`       | Disables PHP from adding its version in HTTP response headers. Reduces fingerprinting risks.                                    |


---

#### 3. Reload PHP FPM to apply changes

```bash
sudo systemctl reload php8.3-fpm
```

Or use your alias:

```bash
fpmr
```

* Reloads the FPM service so new `.ini` changes take effect without restarting the entire web server.

---

‚úÖ **Result:** Your PHP environment is now more secure against attacks that exploit file inclusion, path traversal, and version exposure.
