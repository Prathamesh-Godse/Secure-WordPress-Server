# PHP Hardening with Custom `server_override.ini`

## Purpose

To secure the PHP runtime by disabling risky features and hiding sensitive environment details. This is achieved by applying configuration overrides via a dedicated `.ini` file for PHP 8.3 with FastCGI Process Manager (FPM).

## Structured Document

### 1. Navigate to the PHP FPM Configuration Directory

Move to the directory containing PHP FPMâ€™s override configuration files:

```bash
cd /etc/php/8.3/fpm/conf.d
```

* This location stores `.ini` files that override the default `php.ini` settings.
* All configuration files in this directory are loaded during PHP FPM startup.

---

### 2. Create a Custom Override File

Create a new configuration file to apply hardening rules:

```bash
sudo nano server_override.ini
```

Insert the following settings:

```ini
; HARDEN PHP
allow_url_fopen = Off
cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0
expose_php = Off
```

#### Explanation of Directives

| Directive          | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allow_url_fopen`  | Disables the use of URLs with file-handling functions, preventing remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.          |
| `cgi.fix_pathinfo` | Prevents PHP from attempting to guess the target script name from malformed URLs. Reduces script execution risks. |
| `expose_php`       | Suppresses the PHP version signature in HTTP response headers. Helps avoid information disclosure.                |

### 3. Reload PHP FPM to Apply Changes

To apply the configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload php8.3-fpm
```

Or, if an alias is defined:

```bash
fpmr
```

* Reloading ensures the new `.ini` file is read by the PHP FPM service.
* No need to restart the entire web server.

---

## Best Practices

* Always use `.ini` overrides in the `conf.d` directory for service-specific hardening.
* Keep `allow_url_fopen` disabled in production unless explicitly required.
* Avoid enabling `cgi.fix_pathinfo` to prevent unintended script execution due to path traversal.
* Mask version exposure (`expose_php = Off`) to reduce the surface area for reconnaissance-based attacks.
* Use `php -i` or `php-fpm -tt` to validate configuration changes before reloading services.
* Document each override for auditability and team awareness.
