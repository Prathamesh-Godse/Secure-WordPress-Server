### âœ… Temporary PHP Plugin Access Test â€” And Revert Instructions

You are just running a **controlled test** to verify that your Nginx rules are correctly **blocking direct PHP execution inside plugin directories**, which is a key hardening measure for WordPress.

---

### ðŸ§ª What You Did

1. Created a test PHP file in:

   ```
   /var/www/prathameshgodse.com/public_html/wp-content/plugins/test556.php
   ```

2. Tried accessing:

   ```
   https://prathameshgodse.com/wp-content/plugins/test556.php
   ```

3. Confirmed it was **blocked** due to your security rules:

   ```nginx
   location ~* ^/wp\-content/plugins/.*\.(?:php[1-7]?|pht|phtml?|phps)$ { deny all; }
   ```

---

### ðŸ”“ Temporarily Allowed It

You added a custom `location` block in your site config:

```nginx
location = /wp-content/plugins/test556.php {
	allow all;
	include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
	fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;
	fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
	include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
}
```

This allowed direct execution of that one file for testing.

### âœ… Now Undo (Revert) the Test

1. **Remove the test file:**

   ```bash
   sudo rm /var/www/prathameshgodse.com/public_html/wp-content/plugins/test556.php
   ```

2. **Edit the site config and delete the custom `location` block:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/prathameshgodse.com.conf
   ```

   * Delete:

     ```nginx
     location = /wp-content/plugins/test556.php { ... }
     ```

3. **Reload Nginx:**

   ```bash
   ngt  # test config
   ngr  # reload config
   ```
