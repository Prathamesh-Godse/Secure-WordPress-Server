# Temporary PHP Plugin Access Test — And Revert Instructions

## Purpose

To perform a controlled security verification by temporarily allowing direct execution of a PHP file within the WordPress plugin directory and confirming that the server’s access control rules are effectively preventing unauthorized PHP execution. Once verified, revert the changes to restore secure defaults.

## Structured Document

### Main Configuration Block Used for Temporary Access

```nginx
location = /wp-content/plugins/test556.php {
	allow all;
	include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
	fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;
	fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
	include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
}
```

This `location` block was added temporarily to bypass the global denial rule for PHP execution within plugin directories. It enables execution of `test556.php` for verification purposes only.

---

### What Was Done

1. **Test File Created**
   A PHP file named `test556.php` was placed in the plugin directory:

   ```
   /var/www/prathameshgodse.com/public_html/wp-content/plugins/test556.php
   ```

2. **Verification Attempted**
   The file was accessed via browser:

   ```
   https://prathameshgodse.com/wp-content/plugins/test556.php
   ```

3. **Rule Confirmation**
   It was initially blocked due to the security directive:

   ```nginx
   location ~* ^/wp\-content/plugins/.*\.(?:php[1-7]?|pht|phtml?|phps)$ { deny all; }
   ```

4. **Temporary Override**
   A dedicated `location` block was inserted to permit access to that specific file.

---

### Reverting the Temporary Test

1. **Remove the Test File**

   ```bash
   sudo rm /var/www/prathameshgodse.com/public_html/wp-content/plugins/test556.php
   ```

2. **Edit the Nginx Site Configuration**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/prathameshgodse.com.conf
   ```

   Delete the `location` block added for `test556.php`:

   ```nginx
   location = /wp-content/plugins/test556.php {
       ...
   }
   ```

3. **Reload Nginx**

   Validate the configuration:

   ```bash
   ngt
   ```

   Reload Nginx to apply changes:

   ```bash
   ngr
   ```

## Best Practices

* **Never leave test or debug files in production directories.**
* **Always isolate test exceptions using exact-match `location =` blocks to prevent unintended exposure.**
* **Ensure that all temporary configurations are reverted promptly.**
* **Use logging to track any manual overrides applied during testing.**
* **Reinforce test success criteria—403 for denied access, 200 for successful override—before rollback.**
