### ðŸ§© Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **`keepalive_timeout 5;`**

   * Keeps a connection open for 5 seconds after the last request.
   * Helps reuse connections without reopening a new TCP connection immediately.
   * Low values reduce idle connections in memory.

2. **`keepalive_requests 500;`**

   * Allows up to 500 requests on a single keep-alive connection before itâ€™s closed.
   * Improves efficiency for clients making many requests (e.g., browsers, CDNs).

3. **`lingering_time 20s;`**

   * After a client closes a connection, Nginx will linger for up to 20 seconds to read any remaining data.
   * Helps avoid RST issues when the client is still transmitting data.

4. **`lingering_timeout 5s;`**

   * During lingering, Nginx waits 5 seconds to receive more data from the client.
   * Prevents prematurely killing the connection if small bits are still coming.

5. **`keepalive_disable msie6;`**

   * Disables keep-alive for Internet Explorer 6 (ancient and buggy with persistent connections).
   * Mostly deprecated today, but safe to keep if supporting legacy clients.

6. **`reset_timedout_connection on;`**

   * When a client times out, Nginx sends a TCP RST (reset) instead of FIN.
   * Frees up resources faster and prevents slow-loris-type attacks.

7. **`send_timeout 15s;`**

   * Nginx will wait 15 seconds for the client to read a response before closing the connection.
   * Protects against slow downloaders or stalled connections.

8. **`client_header_timeout 8s;`**

   * Waits up to 8 seconds for the full client request headers.
   * If headers arenâ€™t fully received within this time, the connection is dropped.

9. **`client_body_timeout 10s;`**

   * Waits up to 10 seconds for the full client request body (e.g., form submissions, uploads).
   * Helps prevent abuse from clients who begin sending and then hang.
