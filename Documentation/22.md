# `timeouts.conf`

# Purpose

To configure connection and request timeouts in Nginx to optimize server resource usage, prevent abuse, and maintain efficient handling of client requests.

# Structured Document

```nginx
##
# TIMEOUTS
##
keepalive_timeout        5;
keepalive_requests       500;
lingering_time           20s;
lingering_timeout        5s;
keepalive_disable        msie6;
reset_timedout_connection on;
send_timeout             15s;
client_header_timeout    8s;
client_body_timeout      10s;
```

## Line-by-Line Explanation

### `keepalive_timeout 5;`

* Keeps the connection alive for 5 seconds after the last request.
* Enables clients to reuse the same connection.
* Low values reduce idle memory usage.

### `keepalive_requests 500;`

* Allows up to 500 requests per keep-alive connection.
* Improves performance for clients making multiple requests.
* After 500, the connection is closed.

### `lingering_time 20s;`

* Sets the maximum amount of time Nginx will wait after a client closes the connection.
* Allows Nginx to read any remaining data to avoid sending TCP RST.

### `lingering_timeout 5s;`

* Waits up to 5 seconds during the lingering phase for new client data.
* Prevents abrupt termination if a small amount of data is still incoming.

### `keepalive_disable msie6;`

* Disables keep-alive for clients using Internet Explorer 6.
* Useful when supporting legacy systems with known bugs.

### `reset_timedout_connection on;`

* Sends TCP RST when a connection times out.
* Helps free up resources more quickly.
* Protects against slow-loris-type attacks.

### `send_timeout 15s;`

* Sets the timeout for sending a response to the client.
* If the client doesnâ€™t read within 15 seconds, the connection is closed.

### `client_header_timeout 8s;`

* Waits up to 8 seconds for the complete client headers.
* Helps block slow clients trying to exhaust server resources.

### `client_body_timeout 10s;`

* Waits up to 10 seconds for the complete client body.
* Helps mitigate slow uploads or intentional stalling.

# Best Practices

* Keep timeout values short to prevent slow clients from holding up worker processes.
* Test timeout settings with typical clients to avoid unintended disconnections.
* Use `reset_timedout_connection on;` for additional protection against DoS attacks.
* Avoid very high `keepalive_requests` on resource-limited servers.
* Regularly review client behavior in logs and adjust timeouts accordingly.
