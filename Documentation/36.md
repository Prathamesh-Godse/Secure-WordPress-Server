# Create Web Root Directory for Your Domain

## Purpose

* Establish a clean and organized directory structure for hosting domain-specific content.
* Isolate each domain or subdomain under `/var/www/` for better scalability and management.
* Prepare the environment for configuring Nginx server blocks effectively.

## Structured Document

### 1. Update & Upgrade Packages

Ensure the system is up to date before making changes.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### 2. Install Directory Structure Viewer (Optional)

Install the `tree` utility to visually inspect the folder hierarchy.

```bash
sudo apt install tree
```

### 3. Create Domain-Specific Web Root

Navigate to the web directory and create the domain folder with a `public_html` subdirectory:

```bash
cd /var/www
sudo mkdir -p example.com/public_html
```

* `example.com/`: Root directory for the domain.
* `public_html/`: Public-facing files (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP) go here.

### 4. Verify Directory Structure

Use `tree` to confirm the folder layout:

```bash
tree /var/www
```

Expected output:

```
/var/www
└── example.com
    └── public_html
```

## Best Practices

* Use lowercase and consistent naming for domain directories.
* Avoid placing executable scripts outside `public_html` to reduce exposure.
* Apply appropriate ownership and permissions (`chown`, `chmod`) before serving files.
* Use one directory per domain/subdomain to simplify maintenance and deployment.
* Always validate structure and file access after creation before linking it to the server configuration.
