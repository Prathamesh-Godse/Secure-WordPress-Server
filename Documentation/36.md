## 🌐 Create Web Root Directory for Your Domain

This section outlines how to set up the appropriate directory structure for serving your website (`example.com`) using Nginx.

---

### 🧭 Purpose

* Create a clean directory structure for serving files from `/var/www/`.
* Separate content for each domain or subdomain (e.g., `example.com`, `blog.example.com`).
* Prepare for setting up Nginx server blocks.

---

### 🛠️ Steps

#### 1. Update & Upgrade Packages

Make sure your system packages are up to date.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

---

#### 2. Install the `tree` Utility (Optional)

This tool helps you visually inspect directory structures.

```bash
sudo apt install tree
```

---

#### 3. Create the Directory Structure

```bash
cd /var/www
sudo mkdir -p example.com/public_html
```

* `example.com/` → Root folder for this domain.
* `public_html/` → Folder where HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP files go (accessible by the browser).

---

#### 4. Verify Structure

```bash
tree
```

Example output:

```
.
└── example.com
    └── public_html
```

---

✅ **Next Step**: You can now place your HTML or PHP files in `public_html`, or configure the Nginx server block to serve from this location.
