# Increase Open File Limits (`ulimit`)

# Purpose

Raise the default and maximum number of open file descriptors per user and for the root account. This is essential for high-concurrency applications such as Nginx, MySQL, Node.js, and other socket- or file-intensive services.

# Structured Document

## 1. Check Current Limits

```bash
ulimit -Hn   # Hard limit (maximum allowed)
ulimit -Sn   # Soft limit (in use by default)
```

* The soft limit can be raised up to the hard limit.
* These values affect the number of open files (file descriptors) per user session.

---

## 2. Configure Global Limits

Create a custom limits configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/security/limits.d/custom_directives.conf
```

Add the following lines:

```conf
*       soft    nofile  120000
*       hard    nofile  120000
root    soft    nofile  120000
root    hard    nofile  120000
```

* `*` applies to all users.
* `nofile` refers to the maximum number of open file descriptors.
* Adjust the number (`120000`) based on your workload requirements.

## 3. Ensure PAM Module Enforces Limits

Edit the following PAM configuration files to ensure limit enforcement:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-session
```

Add the line:

```conf
session required pam_limits.so
```

Repeat for non-interactive sessions:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive
```

Add the same line at the end if not already present.

---

## 4. Reboot and Verify

Reboot the system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, confirm the limits:

```bash
ulimit -Hn
ulimit -Sn
```

The values should now reflect the new limits, e.g., `120000`.

# Best Practices

* Set file descriptor limits proactively for servers expected to handle large numbers of concurrent connections or open files.
* Use monitoring tools like `lsof`, `htop`, or system logs to observe descriptor usage over time.
* Prefer defining limits in `/etc/security/limits.d/*.conf` for modularity and maintainability.
* Always verify both interactive and non-interactive PAM sessions enforce your configuration.
* Maintain separate limits for root if administrative services require elevated access.
