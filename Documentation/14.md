# üìà Increase Open File Limits (ulimit)

This section configures **maximum file descriptor limits**, which is important for handling many concurrent connections, file operations, and sockets without hitting system caps.

---

### üß≠ Purpose

* Prevent `Too many open files` errors for applications like **Nginx**, **MySQL**, or **Node.js** under high load.
* Raise file descriptor limits system-wide for all users and specifically for `root`.

---

### üîç Check Current Limits

```bash
ulimit -Hn   # Check hard limit
ulimit -Sn   # Check soft limit
```

* **Hard limit**: maximum allowed value that can‚Äôt be exceeded.
* **Soft limit**: current value in use, can be increased up to the hard limit.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Configure System-wide Limits

Edit limits file:

```bash
cd /etc/security/limits.d
sudo nano custom_directives.conf
```

Add:

```conf
# <domain>    <type>   <item>   <value>
*             soft     nofile   120000
*             hard     nofile   120000
root          soft     nofile   120000
root          hard     nofile   120000
```

* `nofile` refers to open file descriptors.
* `*` applies to all users.
* You can adjust `120000` as needed.

---

### üîÑ Apply Changes

Reboot the server:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Then SSH back in and verify:

```bash
ulimit -Hn
ulimit -Sn
```

---

### üîß Enable PAM Limits Module

To ensure `pam_limits.so` loads properly:

```bash
cd /etc/pam.d
sudo nano common-session
```

Add this line at the end **(if not already present)**:

```conf
session required   pam_limits.so
```

Repeat for non-interactive sessions:

```bash
sudo nano common-session-noninteractive
```

Add again:

```conf
session required   pam_limits.so
```

---

### üîÅ Final Reboot

```bash
sudo reboot
```

SSH back in and confirm:

```bash
ulimit -Hn
ulimit -Sn
```

You should now see values reflecting the increase, e.g., `120000`.

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Apply this **before deploying high-performance web apps or databases**.
* Monitor your server with tools like `htop`, `lsof`, or logs to see if limits are being hit.
* Keep soft limits slightly lower than hard limits in stricter production environments (optional).

### 1. ‚ùì What does `custom_directives.conf` do?

This file is located in:

```
/etc/security/limits.d/custom_directives.conf
```

It is used to define **resource limits** for users, such as:

- Maximum number of open files (`nofile`)
    
- Number of processes (`nproc`)
    
- Stack size (`stack`)
    
- etc.
    

Any file in `/etc/security/limits.d/` with a `.conf` extension is **included automatically** by PAM (`Pluggable Authentication Modules`) when a user logs in. These directives modify a user‚Äôs resource availability at login time.

It is preferred over editing `/etc/security/limits.conf` directly, as this is more modular and maintainable.

### 2. üßæ Explanation of Each Line

```conf
# <domain>    <type>   <item>   <value>
*             soft     nofile   120000
*             hard     nofile   120000
root          soft     nofile   120000
root          hard     nofile   120000
```

Let‚Äôs explain each column:

|Column|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`<domain>`|The user or group the rule applies to (`*` for all users, or `root`)|
|`<type>`|`soft` (current limit) or `hard` (maximum allowed limit)|
|`<item>`|The resource to limit ‚Äî here, it's `nofile` (max open file descriptors)|
|`<value>`|The limit number (e.g., `120000`)|

#### Line-by-line:

1. `* soft nofile 120000`  
    ‚û§ All users can open up to 120,000 files ‚Äî this is their default soft limit (they can raise it up to the hard limit).
    
2. `* hard nofile 120000`  
    ‚û§ All users are absolutely restricted to a maximum of 120,000 open files.
    
3. `root soft nofile 120000`  
    ‚û§ The root user has the same soft limit as regular users.
    
4. `root hard nofile 120000`  
    ‚û§ The root user has the same hard limit ‚Äî you could make this higher if you want root to have elevated access.

### 3. üìÑ What are `common-session` and `common-session-noninteractive`?

These files are part of the **PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)** configuration.

#### ‚û§ `/etc/pam.d/common-session`

- Loaded for **interactive login sessions** (e.g., SSH, local terminal).
    
- Applies resource limits, authentication, and other session-wide configurations.
    

#### ‚û§ `/etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive`

- Used for **non-interactive logins**, like cron jobs, background services, remote scripts, etc.
    

#### The directive you added:

```conf
session required pam_limits.so
```

‚û§ This line tells PAM to **enable and enforce** the resource limits specified in:

- `/etc/security/limits.conf`
    
- `/etc/security/limits.d/*.conf`
    

Without this line, your `nofile` limits won‚Äôt be applied at all ‚Äî they‚Äôll be ignored.

### 4. ‚úÖ Summary

|File/Directive|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`custom_directives.conf`|Contains per-user or global limit directives (e.g., file limits)|
|`* soft nofile 120000`|Allows all users to open 120K files by default|
|`* hard nofile 120000`|Caps all users at 120K open files max|
|`pam_limits.so` in `common-session`|Enforces limits at login time via PAM|
|`pam_limits.so` in `common-session-noninteractive`|Enforces limits even for scripts, cron, etc.|
