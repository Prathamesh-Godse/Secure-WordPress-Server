# PHP Hardening & Optimization (`server_override.ini`)

## Purpose

To secure and optimize PHP-FPM by disabling risky behaviors and adjusting memory and upload-related limits. These changes prepare the PHP runtime for production-grade workloads such as WordPress, Laravel, or other PHP-based applications.

## Structured Document

### 1. Create or Edit the PHP FPM Override File

Navigate to the PHP FPM configuration directory:

```bash
cd /etc/php/8.3/fpm/conf.d
sudo nano server_override.ini
```

Add the following content:

```ini
; HARDEN PHP
allow_url_fopen = Off
cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0
expose_php = Off

; OPTIMIZE PHP
upload_max_filesize = 100M
post_max_size = 125M
max_input_vars = 3000
memory_limit = 256M
;max_execution_time = 90
;max_input_time = 60
```

### 2. Explanation of Each Directive

#### A. Hardening Settings

| Directive               | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `allow_url_fopen = Off` | Disables access to remote URLs in functions such as `fopen()` and `include()`. Prevents remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.       |
| `cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0`  | Prevents PHP from executing scripts when the requested path is ambiguous. Protects against path traversal and remote code execution. |
| `expose_php = Off`      | Removes PHP version from HTTP headers to reduce fingerprinting and reconnaissance attacks.                                           |

#### B. Optimization Settings

| Directive                    | Description                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `upload_max_filesize = 100M` | Sets the maximum allowed file size for uploads. Suitable for media-heavy applications.                    |
| `post_max_size = 125M`       | Sets the limit for entire POST requests. Must be larger than `upload_max_filesize`.                       |
| `max_input_vars = 3000`      | Increases the number of allowable input variables in POST/GET/COOKIE. Useful for large forms.             |
| `memory_limit = 256M`        | Defines the maximum amount of memory a script can consume. Improves stability for memory-intensive tasks. |
| `max_execution_time`         | *(Commented)* Optional setting to define script execution time limit (in seconds).                        |
| `max_input_time`             | *(Commented)* Optional setting to define maximum input parsing time (in seconds).                         |

### 3. Apply Changes

Reload PHP-FPM to activate the new configuration:

```bash
fpmr
```

* `fpmr` is a bash alias for:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl reload php8.3-fpm
  ```
* Reloading the service applies changes without requiring a full Nginx restart.

---

## Best Practices

* Always use override files (`conf.d/*.ini`) instead of modifying the global `php.ini` directly.
* Maintain consistency between upload/post limits and application requirements.
* Avoid excessive `memory_limit` values unless necessary for application performance.
* Leave time-related directives (`max_execution_time`, `max_input_time`) commented unless long-running operations demand them.
* After applying changes, test PHP functionality with tools like `phpinfo()` or `php -i` to confirm settings are active.
* Monitor the PHP error log (`/var/log/php8.3-fpm.log` or application-specific logs) after configuration updates.
