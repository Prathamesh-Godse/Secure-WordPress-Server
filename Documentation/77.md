## ⚙️ Final Integration of FastCGI Cache Exclusion and Headers in NGINX

This setup completes the FastCGI caching configuration by:

* Including cache exclusion rules
* Adding a response header to show cache status
* Testing the setup

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Edit the Site Configuration File

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo nano prathameshgodse.com.conf
```

### ✏️ Step 2: Add the Following Below `location / {}` Block

```nginx
# Include cache exclusion logic and add cache status header
include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_cache_excludes.conf;
add_header X-FastCGI-Cache $upstream_cache_status;
```

* This line should be placed **outside any location block**, typically just after the `location / {}` block.

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_cache_excludes.conf;` | Injects the previously created rules to determine when FastCGI cache should be skipped.                                                               |
| `add_header X-FastCGI-Cache $upstream_cache_status;`       | Sends a custom response header showing whether the response was served from cache (`HIT`, `MISS`, or `BYPASS`). Helps for debugging and verification. |

### 🔁 Step 3: Reload and Restart NGINX

```bash
ngt   # Reload NGINX config
ngr   # Restart NGINX service (if needed)
```

> `ngt` likely means `sudo systemctl reload nginx`
> `ngr` likely means `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

---

### 🧪 Step 4: Test FastCGI Caching

Use `curl` to check response headers:

```bash
curl -I https://prathameshgodse.com
```

Look for this header in the output:

```
X-FastCGI-Cache: HIT
```

* `HIT`: Response was served from cache
* `MISS`: Cache was bypassed or not populated
* `BYPASS`: Cache was skipped due to exclusion rules (e.g., POST, cookies)

---

✅ **Result:**
Your site is now fully equipped with smart FastCGI caching, proper exclusion logic, and debug headers to monitor cache behavior.
