# MariaDB Performance Tuning with MySQLTuner & File Limits

## Purpose

To analyze and improve MariaDB performance by auditing with MySQLTuner, adjusting system-level file descriptor limits, and verifying configurations to support high-load environments.

## Structured Document

### 1. Run MySQLTuner for Performance Insights

MySQLTuner is a script that inspects a running MariaDB instance and provides configuration and performance tuning suggestions.

**Steps:**

```bash
cd
rm fail2ban.deb
mkdir MySqlTuner
cd MySqlTuner
wget http://mysqltuner.pl/ -O mysqltuner.pl
sudo chmod +x mysqltuner.pl
sudo ./mysqltuner.pl
```

**What it does:**

* Analyzes memory usage, query cache, InnoDB settings, and slow queries.
* Suggests optimizations based on live server data.

---

### 2. Check Current File Descriptor Limits

MariaDB may be limited by low open file descriptor settings, which restrict the number of simultaneous files, sockets, and connections.

**Steps:**

```bash
ps aux | grep mysql
cat /proc/<mariadb-pid>/limits
```

* Replace `<mariadb-pid>` with the actual PID.
* Look for the `Max open files` entry (default is often 1024).

---

### 3. Configure Higher File Descriptor Limit via systemd

To raise MariaDB's file descriptor limits safely and persistently:

**Steps:**

```bash
cd /etc/systemd/system/
sudo mkdir mariadb.service.d
cd mariadb.service.d
sudo nano limits.conf
```

**Add the following content to `limits.conf`:**

```ini
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=40000
```

* `LimitNOFILE`: Sets the maximum number of open file descriptors for the MariaDB service to 40,000.

---

### 4. Reload systemd and Restart MariaDB

Apply the new service configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
mariare
```

* `daemon-reload`: Applies the new systemd unit override.
* `mariare`: Assumes a bash alias for `sudo systemctl restart mariadb`.

---

### 5. Verify the Updated File Descriptor Limit

Check that the new file descriptor limit is in effect:

```bash
ps aux | grep mysql
cat /proc/<mariadb-pid>/limits
```

* Confirm that `Max open files` reflects the updated value (40,000).

---

## Best Practices

* Run MySQLTuner periodically to adjust settings as workload changes.
* Avoid setting `LimitNOFILE` too high without proper memory and CPU resources.
* Ensure other system limits (e.g., user-level or global limits) align with service-specific changes.
* Document any overrides made via systemd and track them in version control for reproducibility.
* Monitor logs (`journalctl -u mariadb`) for any startup errors related to limit changes.
