### üõ°Ô∏è Enabling Security Headers for example.com via Nginx

To apply enhanced security headers to your WordPress site hosted on **example.com**, follow these steps:

---

### üß≠ Step 1: Edit the Nginx Site Configuration

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
sudo nano example.com.conf
```

---

### üîß Step 2: Include the Security Headers

Inside the `server` block of your config file, **above** the block:

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
```

add the following line:

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/http_headers.conf;
```

Your modified section will look like:

```nginx
    ...
    include /etc/nginx/includes/http_headers.conf;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm-example.com.sock;
        fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;
        include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
    }
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Test & Reload Nginx

```bash
ngt     # Alias for: sudo nginx -t
ngr     # Alias for: sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

Now your server will send secure headers like:

* `Referrer-Policy`
* `X-Content-Type-Options`
* `X-Frame-Options`
* `X-XSS-Protection`
* `Permissions-Policy`

You can verify this by running:

```bash
curl -I https://example.com
```

and reviewing the response headers.
