# Enabling Security Headers for example.com via Nginx

## Purpose

To apply essential HTTP security headers on the `example.com` domain using Nginx, enhancing protection against clickjacking, MIME sniffing, XSS attacks, and other common vulnerabilities.

## Structured Document

### Nginx Site Configuration with Security Headers

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/chain.pem;

    include /etc/nginx/includes/http_headers.conf;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm-example.com.sock;
        fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;
        include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
    }

    ...
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Security Headers Include**

   * The `http_headers.conf` file contains a predefined set of secure headers.
   * It is included directly inside the `server` block **above** any `location` blocks, ensuring all relevant responses benefit from these headers.

2. **Testing & Reloading**

   ```bash
   ngt     # Alias for: sudo nginx -t
   ngr     # Alias for: sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

3. **Header Verification**
   Use the following command to inspect the response headers returned by the server:

   ```bash
   curl -I https://example.com
   ```

   Look for:

   * `Referrer-Policy`
   * `X-Content-Type-Options`
   * `X-Frame-Options`
   * `X-XSS-Protection`
   * `Permissions-Policy`

## Best Practices

* Always place security header includes at the top of the `server` block for global application.
* Do not define security headers inside `location` blocks unless targeting specific content types.
* Regularly review and update `http_headers.conf` to align with modern browser capabilities and deprecations.
* Use aliases like `ngt` and `ngr` for efficient testing and reloading, but document their actual command equivalents.
* Validate headers using multiple tools such as `curl`, [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com), or browser dev tools.
