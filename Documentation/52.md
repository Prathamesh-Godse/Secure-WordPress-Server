# Securing File Permissions in `/var/www/example.com/public_html/`

## purpose

To restrict access to website files and directories, ensuring only the site owner and webserver group (`www-data`) can read, write, or execute content. This limits exposure to unauthorized users and enhances WordPress site security.

## structured document

### Step 1: Navigate to the Website Root

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com
```

Moves into the main website directory to apply permission changes.

### Step 2: Set Directory Permissions

```bash
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
```

* Applies `770` permissions to all directories:

  * **Owner**: read, write, execute
  * **Group**: read, write, execute
  * **Others**: no access

* Ensures only the user and the webserver group can traverse or modify folders.

---

### Step 3: Set File Permissions

```bash
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
```

* Applies `660` permissions to all files:

  * **Owner**: read, write
  * **Group**: read, write
  * **Others**: no access

* Prevents unauthorized users from reading or modifying sensitive files (e.g., PHP configs, database credentials).

## best practices

* Ensure the directory owner is the user managing the site (`chown example:www-data -R`).
* Regularly audit file permissions after plugin or theme updates.
* Avoid granting `777` or `775` permissions in production environments.
* Restrict SSH or FTP access to trusted accounts only.
* Use a staging server for permission testing before pushing changes live.
