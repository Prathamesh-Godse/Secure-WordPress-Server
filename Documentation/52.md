### 🔐 Securing File Permissions in `/var/www/example.com/public_html/`

#### 📁 Step 1: Navigate to Your Website Root

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com
```

This moves into your website’s root directory.

#### 🔒 Step 2: Set Directory Permissions

```bash
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
```

- `find`: Searches for all directories (`-type d`) under `public_html/`.
    
- `chmod 770`: Sets permissions to:
    
    - **Owner**: read, write, execute
        
    - **Group**: read, write, execute
        
    - **Others**: no access
        
- This ensures only the **site owner** and **webserver group** (e.g., `www-data`) can read/write/execute folders.

#### 🔐 Step 3: Set File Permissions

```bash
sudo find /var/www/example.com/public_html/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
```

- `find`: Looks for all files (`-type f`).
    
- `chmod 660`: Sets permissions to:
    
    - **Owner**: read/write
        
    - **Group**: read/write
        
    - **Others**: no access
        
- This prevents public/anonymous users from reading your files (e.g., config, PHP code).

### ✅ Result

Only the user (`example`, in your case) and the webserver group (`www-data`) can interact with the files and directories — **ideal for WordPress security**.
