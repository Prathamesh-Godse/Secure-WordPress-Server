# `example.com.conf` â€” Secure Nginx Server Block

## Purpose

To define a secure, production-ready Nginx server block for a domain using SSL, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 (QUIC), PHP handling, and caching. This configuration supports modern protocols, enforces HTTPS, and optimizes performance and maintainability.

## Structured Document

### Main Configuration (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com.conf`)

```nginx
# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (Permanent)
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    # 301: Permanent Redirect
    return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
}

# Main Secure Server Block
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    http2 on;
    listen 443 quic reuseport;
    http3 on;

    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    root /var/www/example.com/public_html;
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
        add_header Cache-Control 'no-cache,no-store';
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm-example.com.sock;
        fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;
        include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
    }

    include /etc/nginx/includes/browser_caching.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl_example.com.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl_all_sites.conf;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log.example.com.log combined buffer=256k flush=60m;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log.example.com.log;
}
```

### Explanation & Breakdown

#### 1. HTTP to HTTPS Redirection

* Redirects all HTTP traffic on port 80 to HTTPS using a 301 permanent redirect.
* Ensures a consistent secure experience for all users.
* `$request_uri` maintains the full original path and query string during redirection.

#### 2. HTTPS Listener with HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

* `listen 443 ssl;`: Enables HTTPS on port 443.
* `http2 on;`: Activates HTTP/2 for better performance (multiplexing, header compression).
* `listen 443 quic reuseport;` and `http3 on;`: Enable support for HTTP/3 via QUIC protocol.

#### 3. Server Identity and Root

* `server_name`: Specifies the domain and subdomain handled by this block.
* `root`: Points to the document root of the hosted application or website.
* `index`: Sets `index.php` as the default file for directory access.

#### 4. Main Location Block (`/`)

* `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;`:

  * Attempts to serve the requested file.
  * Falls back to a directory with the same name.
  * Defaults to `index.php` with query strings if neither is found.
* `add_header Cache-Control 'no-cache,no-store';`: Prevents caching of dynamic content.

#### 5. PHP Handling Block

* `location ~ \.php$`: Matches all requests for PHP files.
* `include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;`: Loads standard FastCGI settings.
* `fastcgi_pass`: Sends requests to the PHP-FPM socket for execution.
* `fastcgi_param HTTP_HOST $host;`: Ensures the backend sees the correct host header.
* `include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;`: Applies custom FastCGI performance improvements.

#### 6. Included Configuration Files

* `browser_caching.conf`: Defines long-term cache headers for static assets.
* `ssl_example.com.conf`: Provides domain-specific SSL certificate paths.
* `ssl_all_sites.conf`: Centralized SSL hardening (protocols, HSTS, QUIC, etc.).

#### 7. Logging

* `access_log`: Logs HTTP requests with a buffered setup to reduce disk I/O.
* `error_log`: Records errors to a domain-specific log file for easier debugging.

## Best Practices

* Store this config in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and symlink to `sites-enabled/`.
* Separate reusable configs into dedicated include files to maintain modularity.
* Regularly audit `ssl_all_sites.conf` for cipher updates and deprecated features.
* Use `nginx -t` to test configuration before applying.
* Rotate logs and monitor usage for performance tuning.
* Use `http3` only if your reverse proxy and clients support it fully.
* Adjust PHP socket paths based on your PHP version and pool configuration.
