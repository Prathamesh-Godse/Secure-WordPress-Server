# Enabling Secure HTTP Headers in Nginx

## Purpose

To improve web application security by enabling recommended HTTP response headers in Nginx for protection against common web vulnerabilities such as MIME-type sniffing, clickjacking, XSS, and API abuse.

## Structured Document

### Configuration File

Create or edit the following include file used by your Nginx server block:

```nginx
# /etc/nginx/includes/http_headers.conf

# -------------------------------------------------------
# Add Header Referrer-Policy - Uncomment desired directive
# -------------------------------------------------------
#add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer";
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
#add_header Referrer-Policy "unsafe-url";

# ------------------------------------------------------
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
add_header X-Frame-Options "sameorigin";
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(),midi=(),sync-xhr=(),microphone=(),camera=(),magnetometer=(),gyroscope=(),fullscreen=self https://www.youtube.com, payment=()";
```

Include this configuration inside your Nginx server block using:

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/includes/http_headers.conf;
```

### Header Descriptions

#### Referrer-Policy

```nginx
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
```

* Controls how much referrer information is included with requests.
* `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` is a balanced and secure default:

  * Sends full URL on same-origin requests.
  * Sends only the origin on cross-origin requests.
  * Strips referrer on downgrades (HTTPS to HTTP).
* Alternatives (commented out):

  * `no-referrer`: Disables the `Referer` header completely.
  * `unsafe-url`: Always sends the full URL (not recommended).

#### X-Content-Type-Options

```nginx
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
```

* Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing the content type.
* Reduces exposure to content-type based attacks.

#### X-Frame-Options

```nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options "sameorigin";
```

* Prevents your site from being embedded in iframes from other origins.
* Helps protect against clickjacking.
* `sameorigin`: Only allows frames from the same origin.
* Other values:

  * `DENY`: Blocks all iframe usage.
  * `ALLOW-FROM uri`: Allows specific origins (deprecated, limited browser support).

#### X-XSS-Protection

```nginx
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
```

* Activates built-in browser XSS filters (legacy browsers only).
* Blocks rendering of the page when an attack is detected.
* Note: Deprecated in modern browsers, but harmless to include for backwards compatibility.

#### Permissions-Policy

```nginx
add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(),midi=(),sync-xhr=(),microphone=(),camera=(),magnetometer=(),gyroscope=(),fullscreen=self https://www.youtube.com, payment=()";
```

* Controls access to browser features and APIs.
* All features are disabled except:

  * `fullscreen`: Allowed for your domain and YouTube only.
* Helps protect user privacy and limits misuse of device capabilities.

## Best Practices

* Always include these headers using a shared include file to maintain consistency across all server blocks.
* Regularly test your configuration using tools like [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com) or `curl -I https://yourdomain.com`.
* Avoid overly permissive settings like `unsafe-url` or unrestricted `fullscreen` access.
* Test application behavior after applying headers to avoid breaking legitimate functionality.
* Apply headers at the HTTP level even if your application already sends themâ€”defense in depth is critical.
