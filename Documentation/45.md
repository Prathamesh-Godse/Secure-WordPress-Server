# WordPress Deployment Steps Explained

## Purpose

To deploy WordPress securely and cleanly to the server’s web root, configure appropriate permissions, and perform initial hardening steps post-installation for better maintainability and security.

## Structured Document

### 1. Move WordPress to the Web Root

```bash
sudo rsync -artv wordpress/ /var/www/example.com/public_html/
```

* Transfers WordPress files from the extracted directory to the actual web root directory.
* Options used:

  * `-a`: Archive mode (preserves permissions, symlinks, ownership, timestamps)
  * `-r`: Recursively copy directories
  * `-t`: Maintain modification times
  * `-v`: Show detailed progress

---

### 2. Clean Up Installation Files

```bash
sudo rm -rf latest.tar.gz wordpress
```

* Removes the downloaded archive and temporary WordPress directory.
* Prevents unnecessary storage usage and eliminates potential attack vectors.

---

### 3. Fix File Ownership and Permissions

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data public_html/
```

* Assigns ownership of all website files to the web server user (`www-data`).
* Necessary for:

  * Plugin/theme installation
  * Uploading media
  * Performing updates via the WordPress dashboard

---

### 4. Launch the Installation Wizard

* Open a browser and navigate to: `http://example.com`
* Complete the WordPress setup:

  * Enter the database name, username, and password
  * Set site title
  * Use previously generated admin credentials

---

## Initial WordPress Hardening & Cleanup (Post-Login)

### 1. Set Permalink Structure

* Navigate to: **Settings → Permalinks**
* Select: **Post name**
* Benefit: Clean, SEO-friendly URLs (e.g., `/about/` instead of query-based URLs)

---

### 2. Remove Default Content

* Posts: Delete the “Hello World” post
* Pages: Delete the “Sample Page”
* Plugins: Remove pre-installed plugins like Akismet and Hello Dolly

---

### 3. Remove Unused Themes

* Keep only the latest default theme (e.g., *Twenty Twenty-Four*)
* Delete older or unused themes to minimize vulnerabilities

---

### 4. Customize Admin User Profile

* Go to: **Users → Profile**
* Set:

  * Nickname (e.g., `Prathamesh`)
  * Display Name: Choose the nickname to show publicly instead of the actual username

---

### 5. Enable Maintenance Mode

* Go to: **Plugins → Add New**
* Search: `maintenance mode` or `WP Maintenance Mode`
* Install and activate the plugin
* Configure settings:

  * Enable maintenance mode
  * Add a custom message (e.g., “Site under construction”)
  * Limit access to logged-in users if needed

---

## Best Practices

* Always remove installation files and unused content to reduce attack vectors.
* Use strict file ownership and permissions to avoid permission-related issues.
* Customize user profile display names to prevent username exposure.
* Keep only essential themes and plugins to simplify management and hardening.
* Use maintenance mode while the site is under development or review.
