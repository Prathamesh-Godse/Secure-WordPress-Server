# Securing MariaDB (MySQL) Server

## Purpose

To harden the default MariaDB installation by eliminating common security risks such as anonymous users, remote root access, and unused test databases. This ensures only authorized local access and a properly configured privilege system.

## Structured Document

### 1. Run Secure Installation Script

Execute the built-in script:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Respond to the following prompts:

| Prompt                                 | Answer |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Switch to unix\_socket authentication? | `n`    |
| Change the root password?              | `n`    |
| Remove anonymous users?                | `y`    |
| Disallow root login remotely?          | `y`    |
| Remove test database and access to it? | `y`    |
| Reload privilege tables now?           | `y`    |

This configuration:

* Restricts root login to the local machine.
* Disables anonymous logins.
* Removes default test databases.
* Reloads privilege settings immediately.

### 2. Reboot and Reconnect

Reboot the system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Once the server is back online, reconnect via SSH:

```bash
ssh <username>@<server_ip>
```

### 3. Test MariaDB Access

Verify access using the following methods:

```bash
mysql
```

* May log in via socket authentication if enabled.

```bash
mysql -u root
```

* Will fail if password or socket authentication is required.

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

* Prompts for the root password if previously configured.

```bash
sudo mysql
```

* Recommended for root access when socket authentication is in place.

### 4. Verify Authentication Method

Check current authentication plugins used by each user:

```sql
SELECT user, plugin, host FROM mysql.user;
```

## Best Practices

* Always remove anonymous and unused accounts.
* Avoid remote root login; use SSH and `sudo` for secure access.
* Use strong passwords or socket-based authentication for the root user.
* Regularly review the user privilege table to ensure minimal access.
* Keep MariaDB updated to the latest stable version for security patches.
* Monitor authentication plugins and ensure unused ones are disabled.
