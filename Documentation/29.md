## üõ°Ô∏è Securing MariaDB (MySQL) Server

This section covers how to harden the default MariaDB setup using the `mysql_secure_installation` script, which removes common vulnerabilities like anonymous users, remote root access, and test databases.

---

### üß≠ Purpose

* Secure the MariaDB root account.
* Remove anonymous and insecure defaults.
* Prevent unauthorized access to the database server.
* Ensure the privilege system is properly configured.

---

### üîê Run Secure Installation Script

Execute the following:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Respond to the prompts as follows:

| Prompt                                 | Answer |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Switch to unix\_socket authentication? | `n`    |
| Change the root password?              | `n`    |
| Remove anonymous users?                | `y`    |
| Disallow root login remotely?          | `y`    |
| Remove test database and access to it? | `y`    |
| Reload privilege tables now?           | `y`    |

These settings:

* Ensure root login only from local machine.
* Block anonymous access.
* Delete test databases and users.
* Apply all changes immediately.

---

### üîÑ Reboot and Reconnect

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, SSH back into the server:

```bash
ssh <username>@<server_ip>
```

---

### üß™ Test MariaDB Access

Try accessing MySQL using different methods:

```bash
mysql
```

* May log in automatically using socket authentication (if enabled earlier).

```bash
mysql -u root
```

* Fails if root requires a password or socket authentication is enforced.

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

* Prompts for password (if you set one).

```bash
sudo mysql
```

* Recommended way to access MySQL root via `sudo`.

---

### ‚úÖ Notes

* If you didn't set a root password and socket authentication is disabled, you'll need `sudo` to access MySQL.
* You can verify the current authentication method with:

```sql
SELECT user, plugin, host FROM mysql.user;
```
