## üîç Breakdown of Each Directive

### üîä `listen 80;`

* Tells Nginx to listen for HTTP traffic on port 80 (non-HTTPS).

### üåê `server_name example.com www.example.com;`

* Specifies the domain names this server block will respond to.

### üìÅ `root /var/www/example.com/public_html;`

* Path to the root directory that contains your site‚Äôs files (HTML, PHP, etc).

### üìÑ `index index.php;`

* Defines `index.php` as the default file to serve when a directory is requested.

---

### üì¶ Location Blocks

#### `/` (root location)

```nginx
location / {
	try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
}
```

* First tries to serve the exact file.
* Then tries the directory.
* If not found, routes the request to `index.php`, passing query strings (good for CMS like WordPress).

#### `.php` files

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
	include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
	fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
	include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
}
```

* Handles PHP files using FastCGI and PHP-FPM via Unix socket.
* Includes FastCGI tuning configs from `fastcgi_optimize.conf`.

---

### üß† Caching & Logs

#### `include /etc/nginx/includes/browser_caching.conf;`

* Adds caching rules for static files (e.g., JS, CSS, images) for performance.

#### `access_log` & `error_log`

```nginx
access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log.example.com.log combined buffer=256k flush=60m;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log.example.com.log;
```

* Stores detailed access logs and error logs in domain-specific files.
* Buffers logs (256 KB) and flushes every 60 minutes to reduce disk I/O.

## ‚ö° What is FastCGI?

**FastCGI** is a **protocol** used to interface **external applications** (like PHP, Python, etc.) with web servers (like Nginx, Apache).  
It allows PHP scripts to run **outside the web server process**, so the server doesn‚Äôt need to start a new PHP interpreter for every request.

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

- Faster than traditional CGI (Common Gateway Interface).
    
- Keeps PHP processes alive between requests.
    
- Reduces overhead by **reusing PHP processes**.

## üêò What is PHP-FPM?

**PHP-FPM** (PHP FastCGI Process Manager) is the **actual implementation** of FastCGI for PHP.  
It **manages pools of PHP worker processes**, handling how they are created, reused, and terminated.

### üîß Key Features:

- **Process pooling**: Reuse PHP processes to handle requests efficiently.
    
- **Resource management**: Limits memory, execution time, number of requests per worker.
    
- **Advanced configuration**: You can create multiple pools (each with different PHP versions or settings).
    
- **Security**: Can run each pool as a different user for isolation.
    
- **Better performance and stability** than older mod_php or CGI methods.

## üöÄ How They Work Together with Nginx

Nginx doesn‚Äôt have built-in PHP support. Instead:

1. Nginx receives a request for a `.php` file.
    
2. It passes the request via **FastCGI protocol** to **PHP-FPM**.
    
3. PHP-FPM processes the PHP script and sends the output back to Nginx.
    
4. Nginx sends the final response to the client.
    

---

### üß™ Example from your config:

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
}
```

- Tells Nginx to forward `.php` requests to PHP-FPM using FastCGI over a Unix socket.

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

|Component|Role|
|---|---|
|**FastCGI**|Protocol for server-app communication|
|**PHP-FPM**|Application that handles PHP via FastCGI|
|**Nginx**|Web server that uses FastCGI to talk to PHP-FPM|
