# **Nginx Server Block: `example.com` Configuration**

## **Purpose**

To configure Nginx to serve the website `example.com` using PHP-FPM, FastCGI optimization, and browser caching. This setup enables proper PHP execution, static file caching, logging, and performance tuning for production environments.

## **Structured Document**

### **File: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com.conf`**

```nginx
server {
	listen 80;
	server_name example.com www.example.com;

	root /var/www/example.com/public_html;
	index index.php;

	location / {
		try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
	}

	location ~ \.php$ {
		include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
		fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
		include /etc/nginx/includes/fastcgi_optimize.conf;
	}

	include /etc/nginx/includes/browser_caching.conf;

	access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log.example.com.log combined buffer=256k flush=60m;
	error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log.example.com.log;
}
```

### **Directive Breakdown**

| Directive / Block                          | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `listen 80;`                               | Listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 80.                                              |
| `server_name example.com www.example.com;` | Defines the domain names this server block is responsible for.                              |
| `root /var/www/example.com/public_html;`   | Specifies the root directory for the websiteâ€™s files.                                       |
| `index index.php;`                         | Sets the default index file.                                                                |
| `location /`                               | Attempts to serve static files; if not found, passes the request to `index.php`.            |
| `location ~ \.php$`                        | Matches PHP files and passes them to PHP-FPM using FastCGI.                                 |
| `include fastcgi_optimize.conf`            | Optimizes FastCGI parameters for better performance and stability.                          |
| `include browser_caching.conf`             | Adds caching headers for static assets to reduce load and improve client-side speed.        |
| `access_log` / `error_log`                 | Logs requests and errors separately for this domain. Buffered logging reduces I/O overhead. |

## **Best Practices**

* Use Unix sockets (`fastcgi_pass unix:`) for PHP-FPM to improve performance and avoid TCP overhead.
* Modularize configuration using `include` directives for reusability and clarity.
* Separate logs per domain to aid in debugging and metrics collection.
* Use long-term browser caching for static files to improve user experience and reduce bandwidth usage.
* Always validate Nginx configuration after changes using `nginx -t` before reloading the service.

## **Technical Context**

### **What is FastCGI?**

FastCGI is a high-performance protocol used to interface dynamic applications (like PHP) with web servers. It allows external applications to persist in memory and handle multiple requests efficiently.

**Benefits:**

* Significantly faster than traditional CGI.
* Avoids process spawning overhead.
* Keeps application processes (e.g., PHP) alive between requests.

### **What is PHP-FPM?**

PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is a PHP implementation that manages pools of worker processes for handling requests via FastCGI.

**Key Features:**

* Supports advanced configurations like per-pool settings.
* Provides fine-grained resource control (memory, execution time, request count).
* Improves performance, scalability, and isolation between applications.

### **How Nginx, FastCGI, and PHP-FPM Work Together**

1. **Nginx** receives a request for a `.php` file.
2. It passes the request to **PHP-FPM** via the **FastCGI** protocol.
3. **PHP-FPM** executes the script and returns the output.
4. **Nginx** sends the response back to the client.

**Configuration Example:**

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
	include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
	fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
}
```

This tells Nginx to use PHP-FPM via a Unix socket to execute `.php` files.
