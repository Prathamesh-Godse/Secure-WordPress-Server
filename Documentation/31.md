# MariaDB Optimization & Binary Log Management

## Purpose

To enhance MariaDB performance by minimizing unnecessary resource usage, optimizing memory allocation, and managing binary logs to reduce disk space consumption and improve responsiveness.

## Structured Document

### 1. Disable Hostname Resolution

MariaDB attempts to resolve client hostnames, which can delay client connections. Disabling hostname resolution ensures faster access.

**Steps:**

```bash
cd /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/
sudo nano 50-server.cnf
```

Uncomment or add the following line:

```ini
skip-name-resolve
```

This instructs MariaDB to use IP addresses instead of performing DNS lookups.

**Restart MariaDB:**

```bash
mariare
```

---

### 2. Limit Binary Log Expiry

By default, binary logs accumulate over time and can consume significant disk space. Setting an expiration policy prevents this.

**Edit configuration:**

```bash
sudo nano 50-server.cnf
```

Add or modify the following:

```ini
expire_logs_days = 3
```

**Verify the setting:**

```bash
sudo mysql
```

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'expire_logs_days';
EXIT;
```

---

### 3. Check InnoDB Memory Usage

Inspect MariaDB’s current memory usage and buffer settings:

```bash
htop
```

Then, from the MariaDB shell:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%innodb_buffer%';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%innodb_log%';
EXIT;
```

---

### 4. Tune InnoDB Buffer and Log File Size

Stop MariaDB before making configuration changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mariadb
```

Open the configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano 50-server.cnf
```

Add or modify these settings:

```ini
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 800M
innodb_log_file_size = 200M
```

These values are optimized for systems with 2–4 GB RAM.

**Restart MariaDB:**

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

**Verify updated settings:**

```bash
sudo mysql
```

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%innodb_buffer%';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%innodb_log%';
EXIT;
```

## Best Practices

### `innodb_buffer_pool_size = 800M`

**Function:**
Specifies the amount of RAM allocated to caching frequently accessed InnoDB data and indexes.

**Importance:**

* Reduces disk I/O operations.
* Increases overall query performance.
* Critical for InnoDB-heavy databases.

**Recommendation:**

* On dedicated DB servers: 60–80% of available RAM.
* `800M` is suitable for a system with around 2 GB of RAM.

---

### `innodb_log_file_size = 200M`

**Function:**
Defines the size of each InnoDB redo log file for transactional data before it's flushed to disk.

**Importance:**

* Larger log files reduce write frequency.
* Balances write throughput and recovery time.

**Recommendation:**

* 100M–512M is a practical range for small to medium workloads.
* `200M` is appropriate for general usage on VPS instances with moderate database writes.
