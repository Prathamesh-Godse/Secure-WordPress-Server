## üõ†Ô∏è MariaDB Optimization & Binary Log Management

This part tunes MariaDB‚Äôs performance and reduces unnecessary resource usage by managing log retention, enabling efficient memory use, and minimizing hostname resolution delays.

---

### üß≠ Purpose

* Reduce DNS resolution delays in MariaDB.
* Limit binary log file size and lifespan to save disk space.
* Tune `InnoDB` settings for performance on small to medium servers.

---

### üìù Configuration Steps

#### 1. üîí Disable Hostname Resolution

MariaDB attempts to resolve client hostnames, which can delay connections. Disabling it improves performance.

```bash
cd /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/
sudo nano 50-server.cnf
```

Inside `50-server.cnf`, uncomment the line:

```ini
skip-name-resolve
```

This forces MariaDB to use IPs instead of resolving hostnames.

Then restart MariaDB:

```bash
mariare
```

---

#### 2. üìâ Limit Binary Log Expiry

By default, binary logs are retained for a long time. You can shorten this to conserve disk space:

```bash
sudo nano 50-server.cnf
```

Find and update the log expiration setting:

```ini
expire_logs_days = 3
```

Verify with:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'expire_logs_days';
```

Then exit:

```sql
EXIT;
```

---

#### 3. üß† Check InnoDB Memory Usage

Use `htop` to observe MariaDB's memory usage:

```bash
htop
```

Then inspect the current InnoDB buffer pool and log settings:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%innodb_buffer%';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%innodb_log%';
EXIT;
```

---

#### 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Tune InnoDB Buffer & Log Size

Stop MariaDB to make safe configuration changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mariadb
```

Edit the config file:

```bash
sudo nano 50-server.cnf
```

Search for `innodb_buffer_pool_size` and **add or modify** these lines:

```ini
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 800M
innodb_log_file_size = 200M
```

These values optimize MariaDB for a system with \~2‚Äì4GB of RAM.

Restart MariaDB:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

Then verify the settings again:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%innodb_buffer%';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%innodb_log%';
EXIT;
```

# More

### üß† `innodb_buffer_pool_size = 800M`

**What it does:**

This setting determines **how much memory is allocated to the InnoDB buffer pool**, which is where **MariaDB stores frequently accessed data and indexes** from InnoDB tables.

**Why it's important:**

- It's the **most important performance setting** for InnoDB.
    
- The larger the buffer pool, the more data MariaDB can cache in RAM.
    
- This **reduces disk I/O** and **improves query performance**.
    

**Best practices:**

- On dedicated database servers, set it to **60‚Äì80% of available RAM**.
    
- In your case, `800M` is good for a server with ~2GB of RAM.

### üìÑ `innodb_log_file_size = 200M`

**What it does:**

This sets the **size of each InnoDB redo log file** (used for write-ahead logging). Redo logs store changes made to the database before they're permanently written to disk.

**Why it's important:**

- A **larger log file** reduces the frequency of writes to disk, which is helpful under **write-heavy workloads**.
    
- However, **very large log files** can slow down crash recovery time.
    

**Best practices:**

- For small to medium setups, `100M‚Äì512M` is a safe range.
    
- `200M` is a good balance for moderate workloads on a small VPS.
