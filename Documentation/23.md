# `gzip.conf`

## Purpose

Enable Gzip compression in Nginx to reduce the size of HTTP responses, optimize bandwidth usage, and improve load times for clients.

## Structured Document

```nginx
##
## GZIP
##
gzip on;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\.";
gzip_static on;
gzip_min_length 1400;
gzip_buffers 32 8k;
gzip_http_version 1.0;
gzip_comp_level 5;
gzip_proxied any;
gzip_types text/plain text/css text/xml application/javascript application/x-javascript application/xml application/xml+rss application/ecmascript application/json image/svg+xml;
```

### Explanation (Line by Line)

#### `gzip on;`

Enables Gzip compression for HTTP responses.

#### `gzip_vary on;`

Adds the `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header to inform caches that different versions of content may exist (compressed vs. uncompressed).

#### `gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\.";`

Disables Gzip for Internet Explorer versions 1â€“6 due to known compatibility issues.

#### `gzip_static on;`

Tells Nginx to serve pre-compressed `.gz` versions of files when available (e.g., `main.css.gz`).

#### `gzip_min_length 1400;`

Skips compression for responses smaller than 1400 bytes, where compression may be inefficient or counterproductive.

#### `gzip_buffers 32 8k;`

Defines 32 buffers of 8 KB each for storing Gzip-processed data during compression.

#### `gzip_http_version 1.0;`

Enables Gzip compression for both HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 clients.

#### `gzip_comp_level 5;`

Sets compression level to 5, providing a balance between CPU usage and compression efficiency.

#### `gzip_proxied any;`

Enables compression for all proxied requests, regardless of their headers.

#### `gzip_types ...;`

Specifies MIME types eligible for compression (e.g., CSS, XML, JavaScript, JSON, SVG). HTML is compressed by default and need not be listed.

## Best Practices

* Always test Gzip with real browsers and proxy environments to ensure compatibility.
* Avoid compressing binary files like images; they are already compressed.
* Use `gzip_static` only if your build pipeline includes `.gz` generation.
* Monitor server CPU usage when adjusting `gzip_comp_level` beyond 5.
* Ensure `Vary: Accept-Encoding` is correctly set to avoid cache mismatches in CDNs.
